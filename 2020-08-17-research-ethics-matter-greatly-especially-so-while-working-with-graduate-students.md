Dear AERA Council & Executive Board, 

My name is Joshua Rosenberg and I am an active member of AERA, having been so since 2013. I serve as the co-chair for an AERA Division (Divison C, Section 1D, science education), and am active in the organization, including having reviewed for two AERA journals, presented a worshop on transparent and reproducible research, and presented multiple papers and organized multipled sessions. AERA is the professional organization I care about most. 

I am writing out of dissapointment about a dialogue around the veracity of AERA's proposal submission and review process. What I know is that a scholar publicly apologized for not listening to the concerns of the graduate students with which they worked. According to the student, their concerns had to do with including speculative (and possibly fabricated) findings in an AERA proposal because of the due date for proposals to present at the annual meeting. 

AERA's *2021 Annual Meeting Call for Submissions* is unambigious:

> Authors should only submit complete papers. Proposals to write a paper are not eligible for consideration. 

> Submitters are strongly encouraged to review the elements of presenting well-warranted and transparent work as described in the Standards for Reporting on Empirical Social Science Research in AERA Publications and the Standards for Reporting on Humanities-Oriented Research in AERA Publications.

There *are* gradations in completeness. Design-based researchers, for example, 
might have worked for years in classrooms, and while their analysis of classroom artifacts may be incomplete, their work involved the systematic collection and 
interpretation of data. Moreover, their work was subject to the oversight of an 
Institutional Review Board, and the vicissitudes of carrying out educational research in complex educational systems. The afforementioned concerns raised 
suggested that the findings were speculative; that no data had been collected or analyzed.

This calls into question how trustworthy the review process and, in turn, conference presentations at AERA are. It also poses a difficult and possibly situation for scholars who have _not_ submitted speculative findings as those based on the collection and interpretation of data: Are these scholars disadvantaged by not speculating more at the proposal stage, or have their past submissions been at a disadvantage for not doing so? 

I would like to respectfully request for AERA to clarify expectations for the completeness of work submitted to AERA, as well as the repurcussions for not doing so. I believe such a statement will speak to the trustworthiness of the research presented at the annual meeting, and may contribute to a more fair submission and review process.

Sincerely,

Joshua Rosenberg, Ph.D.
