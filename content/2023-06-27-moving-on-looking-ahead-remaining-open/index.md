I didn’t know it then but my life had turned a page
I tried several weeks ago to capture the past few years in a song. I wasn’t sure what the right song was, but I thought it was [Molly Tuttle’s Grass Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yYfC2Osl0).

> I didn’t know it then,

Sometimes, life operates on a gradient, with things being or becoming a little more good or bad. Other times it is punctuated and spiky, with moments of consequence entering and exiting. Lately, it has been more of the latter.

> but my life had turned a page.

I still think the song is the right one.

We wanted to try to have another kid, but the last few years were hard. Katie had grad school, a job search, and a new job; I was pre-tenure. Covid made everything harder and more anxious. After we were ready, it took a bit longer than we though, but were thrilled when Katie was pregnant. A short time after, Katie had a miscarriage, which was unexpected and hard. We mourned and recovered and tried again, a bit scared but also hopeful. 

After we shared the happy news with friends, I came in from outdoors to hear Katie telling me she thought she was miscarrying again. How could it be, we asked. That night, I was a mess, but Katie was courageous. She said she wanted to tuck our son into bed; to comfort him and her. It was one of the most intense feeling nights I can remember. 

The next morning felt like a pause before something scary and bad, but the day passed, and we woke up and tried to move ahead the following day. Then, the next day came, and Katie went to her doctor. By this point, we were unsure. Katie thought she was miscarrying, but things slowed. I wasn’t sure at all, but had to teach a class. I was a mess, but, sometime before the class started I received a text from Katie that the doctor heard the heartbeat and the baby was fine. I wasn’t sure what I had experienced.

I was still a bit of a mess in the following weeks. On a sleety run with friends, I felt like I had a mild moment of panic around the time we expected to find out the sex of the baby. I got lost from my friends, running in circles, eventually hiking down a river (seriously — and, it was in February!). I felt unsure, and I wasn’t sure what I’d do with bad news. A few days later, when Katie called me during the day to share that she learned the baby was a girl - healthy and growing well - I was a mess again.

We wait for baby, around eight weeks from the due date, but I feel ready to move on and look ahead with anxious happiness and excitement—and to be open to what comes next, whatever that is.
