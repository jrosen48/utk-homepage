With Mine Dogucu and Sibel Kazak, I have written a paper that intends to make Bayesian data analysis accessible and practical for science and mathematics teachers at the high school level. 
The paper is **The Design and Implementation of a Bayesian Data Analysis Lesson for Pre-Service Mathematics and Science Teachers**.

The abstract is here:

> With the rise of the popularity of Bayesian methods and accessible computer software, teaching and learning about Bayesian methods are expanding. However, most educational opportunities are geared toward statistics and data science students and are less available in the broader STEM fields. In addition, there are fewer opportunities at the K-12 level. With the indirect aim of introducing Bayesian methods at the K-12 level, we have developed a Bayesian Data Analysis activity and implemented it with 35 mathematics and science pre-service teachers. In this manuscript, we describe the activity, the web app supporting the activity, and pre-service teachers' perceptions of the activity. Lastly, we discuss future directions for preparing K-12 teachers in teaching and learning about Bayesian methods.
