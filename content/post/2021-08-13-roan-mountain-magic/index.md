Back in April, I ended up camping and backpacking a bunch, especially [with our little one](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2021/04/18/a-difference-between-backpacking-with-and-without-little-ones/), and it was great. Then [summer stress](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2021/08/05/summer-stress/) began, and I hadn't made it out much from June - July. But, I've now been out four times in the last month, including to [Roan Mountain](http://www.roanmountain.com/), which was reinvigorating in a way that past trips were not.

It is, in short, a magical place, and that's really all I have to say for now.
