Alyson Klein published a story late last week on teachers and chatGPT---a "large language model" I [played around with](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2023/01/25/three-haiku-with-help-from-ai/) [a bunch](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2023/01/25/a-few-more-poems-and-haikus-with-assistance-from-ai/) last week in preparation for sharing a few thoughts on this new technology. I had talked with Alyson before about [the potential privacy risks to students associated with schools and districts social media activity](https://www.edweek.org/technology/school-facebook-pages-and-privacy-concerns-what-educators-need-to-know/2022/11).

The story is [here](https://www.edweek.org/technology/can-digital-tools-detect-chatgpt-inspired-cheating/2023/01). I tried to see things from the teacher perspective while recognizing the potential usefulness of chatGPT and tools like over a longer time horizon. 

> “I totally empathize with teachers who are like, ‘What the heck? It’s January! It’s been a crazy three years,’” Rosenberg said. “‘And I want to make sure that my students are understanding writing or English language arts concepts that I want them to learn and that [they] are expected to learn based on our state standards. I can’t radically transform my classroom just yet.’”

> > Educators will ultimately need to figure out how to teach writing in a way that incorporates tools like ChatGPT, said Joshua Rosenberg, an assistant professor of STEM education at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.

I also shared some skepticism about tools that purport to detect GPT-written text:

> Teachers who rely on these detectors need to be aware of their limitations, Rosenberg said.

> It would be unfortunate for a detector to erroneously conclude that a bot-crafted essay was human-produced. But it could be even worse for a student who completed an assignment honestly to be accused of using tech to cheat, Rosenberg said.

> That “could put a student through a really negative, possibly humiliating process,” Rosenberg said.

> Teachers who don’t want their students using ChatGPT as a writing tool need to make that expectation clear from the outset, Rosenberg said.

> If a student’s essay is flagged by an AI detector, teachers should see that as a “starting point for a conversation”—not a final verdict, Rosenberg said. Teachers could ask students to tell them about their writing process and “recognize that the tool might be wrong,” he said.

> The truth could also be complicated. Students may have used AI as a starting point for generating ideas, or employed a tool like Grammarly, which may rewrite sentences to make them more coherent, Rosenberg said.

Conversations with friends and colleagues shaped these thoughts; it was fun to get to try to capture some of these when talking with Alyson again.
