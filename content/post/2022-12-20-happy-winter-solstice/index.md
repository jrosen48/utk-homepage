Happy Winter Solstice---the most joyous day of the year.

My Mom listened to the album this song is on when I was growing up. I think it captures the spirit of the winter solstice, the shortest and darkest but also the day with the greatest potential for things getting better. For these reasons, I look forward to the solstice all year.
