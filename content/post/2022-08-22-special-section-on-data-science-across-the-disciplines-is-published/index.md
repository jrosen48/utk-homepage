The special section of the *British Journal of Educational Technology* on *Data Science Education Across the Disciplines* is officially published [here](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14678535/current). There are nine articles that broadly explore the topic of what data science education is or can be across subject matter disciplines---from art education to science education. There is one editorial, two review papers, and six empirical papers; five of these articles are "free" or open access. It was great to work with Shiyan Jiang and Victor Lee to co-edit this; it was a great editorial experience working with these two excellent scholars and the team of article authors. I'm happy to share (and re-read and cite) the results of this work looking ahead.
