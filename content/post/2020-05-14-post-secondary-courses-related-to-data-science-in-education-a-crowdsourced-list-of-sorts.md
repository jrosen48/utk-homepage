I solicited information baout courses related to data science in education, and ended up with more than I expected. This is a crowdsourced list, with courses spanning data science education (data science as a new context for teaching and learning) and the application of different data science methods to learning analytics and educational data mining:

* [Applied Social Network Analysis in Education](https://bookdown.org/chen/snaEd/) (Bodong Chen)
* [Learning Analytics: Theory and Practice](https://colig.github.io/laumn/) (Bodong Chen)
* [Carpe Datum](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/current-students/register-classes/student-advisement/undergraduate-advisement/liberal-arts-core) (Yoav Bergner)
* Theoretical Foundations of Learning Analytics and Learning Analytics in Practice (forthcoming) (Nia Dowell)
* [Data Science Specialization](https://github.com/uo-datasci-specialization) (five courses) (Daniel Anderson)
* [Big Data and Education](https://www.edx.org/course/big-data-and-education) (Ryan Baker)

* Data Science Education (and Data Science Education for pre-service teachers) (Victor Lee)
* Foundations of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Science (Alyssa Wise)
* [Building Learning Analytics Applications](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/courses/building-learning-analytics-applications) (Alyssa Wise)
* Certificate Program in Learning Analytics (four courses) (Shaun Kellogg)

If I made any omissions or mistakes, I'm sorry - I will correct this as soon as I learn I made them. This (clearly) is not a comprehensive list, but is also clearly a good one. If referred to by anyone other than myself, consider this just a snapshot in time of a subset of the wider educational community exploring these topics.

I asked because I am interested in offering a data science in education course at my institution - and it was and is very valuable to learn what others have created or will be offering in the near future.
