You're likely reading, seeing, or experiencing what is on the news, and feeling 
heartbroken.

I have only a little to add, but I do have something to. 

Getting better is hard; healing from a serious injury is hard. One way to think
about, America and the Constitution (the and Bill of Rights) is as a promise, 
or a dream. From the start, that promise was compromised. Enslaved men and women
built America, and Americans killed the men and women who lived on the land on 
which the nation started.

The murder of George Floyd at the hands of police officers had recent and
historical precedent. It was done by men in plain sight who are responsible for 
the cruel thing they did. The murder of George Floyd was also the result of 
racist practices---those many of us are complicit in---and racist policies. 
The murder of George Floyd was also the result of not healing from breaking the
promise of America, the thing, and the Constitution on which we were founded. 

It's evident that what we've not done is wrestle with the 
past in the way we have needed to - like [how Germans have with being
responsible for the Holocaust](https://www.thelocal.de/20161019/how-germany-remembers-the-holocaust-world-war-two-nazis-jewish-history-germans). It's evident driving around Michigan and it's evident 
driving around Tennessee and North Carolina that we are not clear about what our
country's racist, evil, destructive past meant and still means.

As one example, in Tennessee, [a state park is named for the founder of the 
Ku Klux Klan, Nathan Bedford Forrest](https://tnstateparks.com/parks/nathan-bedford-forrest).
[Nathan Bedford Forrest day](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/12/tennessee-nathan-bedford-forrest-day-gov-bill-lee-signs-proclamation/1684059001/) is---still---a day of observation in Tennessee.

This is better known, but Confederate flags are commonplace, especially when you travel
out of Metropolitan areas; the Confederacy seceded because of slavery; read the articles of 
secession for GA, MI, SC, TX, and VA [here](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states). Those wearing
or waving the flag of the Confederacy either do not wish to know or do not wish to know what message doing so
communicates. Driving to Obed Wild and Scenic River on Saturday, we drove past a women
mowing her lawn with a Confederate flag tattoo. We drove past a house with American, Confederate, and Trump
flags, all equal heights. This isn't newsworthy; not at all. It's ubiquitous anywhere off the beaten path in, at least, Michigan, Tennessee, and north Carolina. Try driving from Asheville to Winston-Salem without driving past the largest flag you will likely have seen. It's a Confederate flag flying over I-40, which spans from North Carolina to California.

I travel past the [Daughters of the Confederacy memorial hall](https://www.bleakhouseknoxville.org/daughters-of-the-confederacy) to make it to campus in progressive Knoxville, where we live. There is a [Confederate status](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2017/12/21/knoxvilles-fort-sanders-confederate-statue-likely-stay/973439001/) in the main student residential area. 

These are all true (to the best of my knowledge). I notice them, but there is a 
great deal that I don't notice, know about, or place myself in opportunities to
know.

There are many reasons for George Floyd's murder; the actions of the police officers, racist
policies and practices, and a hypocritical history that we are still grappling with. 

Our past and how Black men and women are treated in the present can be attempted
to be ignored, but doing so means that we're not really living in the country
we say and think we are. This means that our promise and dream are not being 
realized. This also means that we need to be uncomfortable; to make changes
to how we are thinking, feeling, and acting. Getting better is hard; healing is
hard, but healing the broken heart of our country is needed, and doing 
so asks all of us to work to do so, starting with myself. I started to think and
write about this [last week](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2020/05/29/practice-justice/); 
I will continue to do so in the weeks, months, and years ahead, and invite you 
to share with me as I do so.
