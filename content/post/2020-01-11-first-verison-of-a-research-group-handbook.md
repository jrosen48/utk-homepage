I wrote a first version of a research group handbook. Part of the joy of working with more students is the need to try to have greater structure around advising, carrying out projects, and meeting. 

The handbook (view only via this link) is here on Google Docs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13YmeUU4lSGWVqZfmCGljnJ4nTbD26TaY7oH3LUWo7Zk/edit?usp=sharing

Feedback is welcomed!

Thanks to [Teya Rutherford](https://rutherfordlab.wordpress.com/) for sharing the handbook for her research group. Thanks to [Bodong Chen](https://bodong.me/) for posting his [statement of graduate advising](https://bodong.me/post/2019-08-20-advising-statement/). Both of these were inspirations for the above.
