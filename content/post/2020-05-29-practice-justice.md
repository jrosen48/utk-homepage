I've struggled with words the past few days, feeling incapable of saying 
something that captured what I felt-perhaps because I didn't know what to think. 
What is clearer to me now is that there are injustices that are alive and 
present and that I have a role in righting. 

There are a number of practices I do that I'm proud of, but righting 
injustices has not been an active, present one. My read of [Kendi's book](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/how-to-be-an-antiracist-1) 
is that righting injustice is an action: Actions (and practices) are 
uncomfortable at first to establish, but taking and being involved in them
is their own reward because they're the right thing to do. 

So, I commit to making progress on my practice of righting injustice, including
the racist injustice of the past week, but also those in the past and future.
