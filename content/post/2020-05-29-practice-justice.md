I've struggled with words the past few days, feeling incapable of saying something
that captured what I felt - perhaps the result of not knowing what I thought 
and felt.

What is clearer to me now is that there are injustices that are alive and 
present and that I have a role in righting. 

There are a number of practices I do that I'm proud of. Righting inujustices has
not been one. 

My read of [Kendi's book](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/how-to-be-an-antiracist-1) 
is that righting injustice is an action - a practice. Practices are 
uncomfortable to establish, but being involved in them is their own reward.
