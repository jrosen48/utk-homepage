This year has been full of challenges that provoked growth from the start to the finish. This was a humbling year, too. It was a year in which I grew mentally and, in a little way, faithfully, It was a year in which I learned that successes can be followed by failures and that that process doesn't stop---and that there may never be a single moment when absolutely everything is set, finished, done, complete, and joyful. It was a year when joy and confidence was followed with sorrow and uncertainty. It was a good year and I look forward to the next one.
