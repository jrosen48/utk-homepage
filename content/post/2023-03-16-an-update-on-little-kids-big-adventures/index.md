My wife Katie and I are working on a hiking book in our abundant free time. It's tentatively titled: *Little Kids, Big Adventures Around Knoxville, Tennessee: Learning About and Experiencing the Tennessee Valley, Cumberland Plateau, and the Great Smoky Mountains*. I've blogged about it before [here](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/05/06/little-kids-big-adventures-to-be-published-by-ut-press/). I love working with Katie on it --- my best collaborator!
 
Here's [an example chapter](https://littlekidsbigadventures.com/seven-islands-loop-trail.html) on one of our favorite places close to Knoxville, Seven Islands State Birding Park.

The book will be published by [UT Press](https://utpress.org/), which is a great fit given the focus of the book. I was happy to see UT Press took out an ad in the latest issue of the Great Smoky Mountains Association's magazine on the Smokies - that's part of the audience for the book, along with parents and guardians of kids in and around Knoxville and - more widely - East Tennessee.

Anywho, we've made some progress over spring break, and a part of what we've worked on is a simplified structure for each chapter (of which there will be around 20 in total, including hikes near to Knoxville like Seven Islands as well as hikes on the Cumberland Plateau and in and around the Smokies). 

The simplified structure for each chapter is below. What can we do better? Any and all feedback is welcome. In addition to Seven Islands, we also drafted and shared [a chapter on Abrams Creek](https://littlekidsbigadventures.com/abrams-creek.html), though we plan to revise both extensively.
