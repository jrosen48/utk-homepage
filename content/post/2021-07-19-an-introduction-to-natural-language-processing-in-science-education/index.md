I presented a short workshop today on 'An Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Science Education' at IPN â€“ Leibniz Institute for Science and Mathematics Education. This follows on the workshop I carried out in early May at the [Machine Learning and Computer-Based Text Analysis conference](https://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/en/the-ipn/news/gdcp-focus-conference-machine-learning-and-computer-based-text-analysis-may-6th-7th-2021-register-now).

Thank you [Marcus Kubsch](https://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/de/das-ipn/abteilungen/didaktik-der-physik/mitarbeiter/kubsch-marcus) for the invitation and thank you to [Christina Krist](http://www.christinakrist.org/) for helping to plan this and presenting the next workshop in this three-part series.
