My colleague and [book](http://datascienceineducation.com/) co-author [Ryan Estrellado](https://ryanestrellado.com/) and I have a new podcast, [*About Practice*](https://anchor.fm/about-practice). It's a podcast about the divide between research and practice in education and how those on either side of the divide can build bridges to the other. Check it out if you're interested!

Here's the first episode:

In an upcoming episode, we'll discuss how we each keep up with educational research, development efforts and initiatives, and news. This post represents my attempt at capturing some of the idea I have prior to our conversation. It's organized by type. I'm providing fairly minimal annotation but will say more in the pod; consider subscribing to it!

This is an incomplete list that I'll likely revise after we talk.

## Journals

I find the best way to keep up with journals to be subscribing to the journal's feed via RSS. I use [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) (though I miss Google Reader!). I like to their feeds below.

Here are some journals I keep up with; I at least like to see the titles of articles in these, checking articles of interest/relevance (by way of my University's library for those that aren't open-access):

- [*Educational Researcher*](https://journals.sagepub.com/connected/edr#rss)
- [*AERA Open*](https://journals.sagepub.com/connected/ero#rss) (open-access)
- [*American Educational Research Journal*](https://journals.sagepub.com/connected/aer#rss)
