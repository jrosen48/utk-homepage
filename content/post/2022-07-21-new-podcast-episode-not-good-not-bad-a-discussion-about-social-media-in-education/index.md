For the first time in some time, there's a new episode of my podcast with Ryan Estrellado, [About Practice](https://anchor.fm/about-practice). Here's an overview of the podcast:

> In this episode, Ryan and Josh speak with Jeff Carpenter and Catharyn Shelton about their recent article on education influencers (co-authored with Stephanie Schroeder). Jeff, Catharyn, and Stephanie's article is "The education influencer: A new player in the educator professional landscape" and was published in the Journal of Research on Technology in Education earlier this year: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15391523.2022.2030267
