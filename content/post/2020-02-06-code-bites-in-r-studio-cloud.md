In [research group](makingdatasciencecount.com) meetings, we start with a short (5-10 minutes) activities focused on trying out something new. So far, these activities have been focused on computer science or data science ideas. This post shares a few of those, which have been somewhat useful (I think!) so far:

- Writing and "using" a recipe for making pancakes (to explore the idea of an how computers closely follow the instructions they are told, as well as algorithms, conditional logic, and functions)
- Exploring what one notices about [weather/climate-related data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/year-in-weather.html#tys)
- Tinkering with [a cool agent-based model for frog adaptation](https://litl.sesp.northwestern.edu/FrogPond/index.html?debug=true)
- Last, today, we used *code bites* in R/RStudio, with the goal being to create minimally viable (and interesting) content; it worked well, I think, by lowering the motivation-related barrier to writing code. We used the project here (accessible to anyone): https://rstudio.cloud/project/918794
