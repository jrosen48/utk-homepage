<p><a href="https://otter.ai">Otter</a> is a service for transcribing audio. It works pretty well as a starting
point for transcription (though definitely needs some careful checking). I’ve been using it for
an interview-based research project.</p>
<p>One feature that could be added is the ability to export the transcript in a more
usable form; particularly, as a CSV file - one which can easily be opened using spreadsheet
and other software (e.g., R, if one wanted to carry out an automated/an NLP analysis).</p>
<p>Otter does allow you to easily export a plain text (.txt) file. This file can be wrangled
into a tidy CSV file. This post includes a link to a function to do that.</p>
<p>Here, you can see that I copied the text file into a Google Sheet (how I thought I’d analyze it, first).
This could be modified to read the text file directly; instead of <code>read_sheet()</code>, the function <code>read_lines()</code>
should, I believe, return the same results as <code>read_sheet()</code>.</p>
<p>While _the exported file contained only one column, alternating the speaker name (and time stamp)
in the same row and the text of what the speaker said in the next, the returned data frame
is a tidy data frame with three columns, one each for the time stamp, speaker, and text. I don’t
show the result here because the interview data is not anonymized.</p>
