A few weeks ago, I wrote about an attempt to understand how United States (U.S.) school districts
are responding to COVID-19 
([link here](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/posts/how-are-u-s-school-districts-responding-to-covid-a-first-look-at-12-500-districts-websites/)). A big
part of that earlier work was a map depicting the number of districts within states mentioning COVID-19. 

With inspiration, ideas, and help from([Teya Rutherford](https://rutherfordlab.wordpress.com/), [Daniel Anderson](Daniel Anderson), [Alex Lishinski](http://www.alexlishinski.com/), and [Ha Nguyen](https://ha-nguyen.net/)), 
the underlying data is more trustworthy and the map is now *interactive* (at the district level) and is available from here 
(or by clicking the screenshot below):

We're looking to continue and expand this work - to make it more useful to others and 
(going ahead) to try to ask and answer questions about how districts are responding 
(in ways that may be more or less fair in terms of what students are involved in 
doing. Such a project would likely involve programatically accessing districts' websites, 
but also qualitative coding (or validation), Natural Language Processing, extracting 
text from PDFs, and understanding the role of districts in the wider system. It's complex!

We welcome ideas and input.

Also, h/t to [Isabella Vel√°squez](https://ivelasq.rbind.io/) for talking through and 
sharing advice about multiple aspects of this project.
