are responding to COVID-19 
([link here](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/posts/how-are-u-s-school-districts-responding-to-covid-a-first-look-at-12-500-districts-websites/)).

With some colleagues ([Teya Rutherford](https://rutherfordlab.wordpress.com/), [Daniel Anderson](Daniel Anderson), [Alex Lishinski](http://www.alexlishinski.com/), and [Ha Nguyen](https://ha-nguyen.net/)), 
the map is now interactive (see a screenshot below) and is available from here: https://joshuamrosenberg.com/posts/how-are-u-s-school-districts-responding-to-covid-a-first-look-at-12-500-districts-websites/.
