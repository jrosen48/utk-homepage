When my co-authors Ryan, Emily, Isabella, and Jesse and I wrote a book, [*Data Science in Education Using R*](datascienceineducation.com/), we were inspired by the authors of other books (e.g., [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) within the R universe who made their contents freely-available---in addition to publishing a version that could be purchased in print or eBook formats.

Routledge/Taylor & Francs--specifically our wonderful editor Hannah Shakespeare--supported us in doing this, something for which we were grateful. I wrote a blog post trying to sum up some ideas around this mode of publishing ([here](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2020/07/01/open-source-authorship-of-data-science-in-education-using-r/)), but still have a ton of questions about this mode of publishing, such as:

- What impact did the freely-available version of the book have?
- Did having a freely-available version mean that fewer copies of the physical/eBook were sold (a hard to answer question!)?
- Could the book have been open not in terms of being accessible, but also licensed in such a way that permits others' re-use (e.g., a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/))?
- How many people have used the book?

The last question is relatively easy to answer because we used Google Analytics; this lets us speak roughly to how many people are accessing the book. Inspired by other efforts to document access of open resources (e.g., [EdTechBooks](https://edtechbooks.org/impact)), **here is a brief look at the last year**:

- 13,584 people accessed the website (https://datascienceineducation.com)
- They were primarily from the U.S. (5,088 users), followed by China, (577), the U.K. (544), India (532), Brazil (492), and Germany (417)
- These people did so across 25,363 sessions, at an average of 1 minute, 47 seconds per session
- There were 49,029 page views over this period of time
- Pretty consistently, around 200-250 people have accessed the book per week over the past year

**Looking over the past _two__ years**, those numbers are about doubled:

- 23,000 (precisely) users
- 41,705 sessions
- 89,977 page views

This is, obviously, a coarse look. How useful was the book? What problems did people encounter? And, how did they use it?
