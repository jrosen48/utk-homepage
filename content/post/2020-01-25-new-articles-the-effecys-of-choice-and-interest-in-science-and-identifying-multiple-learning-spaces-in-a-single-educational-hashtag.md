I'm excited to share links to two articles published in the past month!

The first, on how the regularly-occurring chats that take place through an education-focused Twitter hashtag are distinct from the rest of the time (i.e., non-chat times when people use the hashtag), is by [Spencer Greenhalgh](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/) et al. in *Computers & Education*. Here is the abstract:

> The existing work on teacher-focused Twitter hashtags typically frames each hashtag as a single, unified phenomenon, thereby collapsing or erasing differences between them (and any resulting implications for learning). In this study, we conceived of teacher-focused hashtags as affinity spaces potentially containing subspaces distinguished by synchronous chats and other, asynchronous communication. We used computational methods to explore how participation differed in terms of content, interactions, and portals between these contexts within the #michED hashtag used by Michigan teachers. During the 2015–2016 academic year, #michED saw more non-chat activity than chat activity, and most participants only engaged in one mode of activity or the other. Participation during chats was associated with more replying as well as more socially-, affectively-, and cognitively-related content, suggesting a focus on social interaction. In contrast, non-chat participation was associated with more retweeting, mentioning, hyperlinks, and hashtags, suggesting a focus on content dissemination. These results suggest that different affinity spaces—and different literacy practices—may exist within the same hashtag to support different objectives. Teachers, teacher educators, and researchers should therefore be careful to make these distinctions when considering Twitter as a learning technology for teachers.

The other, on the effects of (learners) being able to make choices and their learning, and how that relates to their interest in what they are learning, is by Patrick Beymer et al. and is in *Learning and Individual Differences*. Here is the abstract:

> Having choices during learning is often touted as beneficial for student motivation. However, it is not clear whether the motivating factor is choice or the act of pursuing tasks that are of greater interest, which is often afforded by choice. Using data collected via the Experience Sampling Method from 244 youth (ages 14–18) in the United States, we explore the effects of choice and interest on student engagement, affect, and learning in multiple high school science classrooms from a single high school. Results of multilevel modeling indicate that choice and interest are independently associated with engagement, affect and learning, though effect sizes are larger for interest. Momentary interest was also found to be a stronger predictor than initial interest. Further, the specific types of choices educators offer (e.g., who to work with, how to do an activity, how to allocate time) are differently associated with affect, learning, and engagement.

I will try to post or link to a version of the article that is acceptable after those dates when March 5 and March 15 come about.
