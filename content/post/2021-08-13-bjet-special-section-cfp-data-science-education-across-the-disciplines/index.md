With [Shiyan Jiang](https://ced.ncsu.edu/people/shiyan-jiang/) and [Victor Lee](https://profiles.stanford.edu/victorlee), I am editing a special section of the *British Journal of Educational Technology* on *Data Science Education Across the Disciplines*. 

Here is an overview:

> Data science is often described as the integration of computational and technological tools, statistical knowledge, and disciplinary expertise, and is a rapidly growing topic for dedicated study during post-secondary education (e.g., National Academies of Science, Engineering, & Medicine, 2018). Increasingly, we are seeing new efforts are underway in many places to bring data science to primary and secondary education. Yet, it is still unclear what should constitute a data science education for these grade levels and how data science would be integrated into a very densely packed curriculum. Educational technology is central to these questions, as digital tools are implicated in the production, collection, and analysis of data (Jiang & Kahn, 2020; Lee & Wilkerson, 2018). This special section of the British Journal of Educational Technology (BJET) will showcase and critically examine current approaches using technology to support the teaching and learning of primary and secondary school data science education within and across multiple disciplines.

This special section on data science education across the disciplines will feature an international collection of papers on topics including but not limited to the following:

* The design of technologies and technology-rich contexts for teaching and learning data science
* The integration of technology-enriched data science across subject areas for primary and secondary-aged learners
* Synthetic literature-based reviews and critical arguments regarding the role of technology in pre-collegiate data science education
* Rigorous evaluations of novel technology-enhanced learning activities for data science education
* The use or development of theory for pre-collegiate, technology-enhanced data science education

Key dates include abstract submissions due August 31, 2021 and full paper submissions being due November 15, 2021, with the papers expected to be published July, 2022.
