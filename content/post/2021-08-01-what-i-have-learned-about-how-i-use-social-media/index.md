When we moved from Lansing, MI, to Knoxville, TN, in 2018, I started exploring ways of using social media that were less distracting and more rewarding. The first thing I tried was drastic - I deleted almost all of my social media accounts. Having had the same Facebook account since my first year of college (in 2006), and a Twitter and LinkedIn account from roughly the same time, I figured I was ready for a fresh start. I also created a new Google account; I'd had the same Google account since around then.

Perhaps expectedly, this caused some inconveniences, and, if I had the chance to do it over, I probably would have deleted my Google account, but not the others, as the positive effects that can come from having a network of friends, family, and peers is quite valuable. I was able to recreate my Twitter account with the same network, but not the others. But, the effect of these changes was somewhat positive, in that I used social media in a less distracted way. I've slowly recreated the accounts, including - this past week - LinkedIn. I've also tried to take social media breaks, but they don't last very long. 

In the course of recreating what I'd had (and deleted!), I've found that social media is **relatively not distracting** when I use it to _read_ or _amplify_ content. For example, I can check-in on Facebook or Twitter a few times a day, read/favorite/save for later posts, and then sign-of. I can also amplify content that I like or just want to share from others and can share posts from my blog, like this one. 

I've found that social media is considerably **more distracting** to me when I _share personal posts_ or updates - e.g., photos of my son or our family, or professional updates. In these cases, I can't stop checking for who liked or interacted with my post last. 

So, I wonder if a way to use social media is to share or amplify content, but not share personal posts, apart from those initiated in other places (namely, content on this blog, which Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn do not own). This is less efficient in some ways; social media is tailored to engaging with shorter posts, and having to click a link to a blog post to e.g. read about some update is likely to lead to less ... well, likes/interactions. But perhaps that is okay.
