I mentioned in [a post from a few weeks ago](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2023/06/04/first-thoughts-and-reflections-on-amsterdam-and-the-netherlands/) that I was working with the [JASP statistical software](https://jasp-stats.org/) team. Here are just a few notes following up from that productive working meeting.

- Right now, JASP is used primarily by undergraduate and graduate students in *psychology* and the *social sciences*
- It could have utility for high school-aged students interested in carrying out statistical data analysis, particularly as it is free, open-source, and low-barrier but high-ceiling in its capabilities; it could make for a very nice complement to [other tools that teachers use](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.13245), including spreadsheets and graphing calculators
- One big potential barrier to its use is that it is, for practical purposes, laptop-computer-based---there isn't a very user-friendly web-based version, and the Chromebook installation is a chore
- The plan is to add a *Teaching Science* module to JASP, focused for now on two standards in the Next Generation Science Standards:
    - Measuring and comparing biodiversity (NGSS [LS2-1](https://www.nextgenscience.org/pe/hs-ls2-1-ecosystems-interactions-energy-and-dynamics))
    - Analyzing data on force and motion (NGSS [PS2-1](https://www.nextgenscience.org/pe/hs-ps2-1-motion-and-stability-forces-and-interactions))
- There is good documentation for contributing a module to JASP; see [here](https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-desktop/blob/stable/Docs/development/r-analyses-guide.md) and [here](https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-desktop/blob/stable/Docs/development/jasp-qml-guide.md) for the "server" and "UI" sides of the module, respectively.

More to come!
