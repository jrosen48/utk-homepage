I was caught off guard when I received a message around two weeks ago from a reporter at [EdWeek](https://www.edweek.org/), one of if not the largest organizations for news related to education. A reporter, Sarah Sparks, came across my recent article with Marcus Kubsch, E.-J. Wagenmakers, and Mine Dogucu. That article is available open-access here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-022-00341-3. I can't help but wonder whether its accessibility played a role in the article being noticed by EdWeek and Sarah Sparks. I spoke with Sarah, who asked me to if I could recommend science teachers with whom she could speak about the ideas in the article and how they "look" in science classrooms, and so I connected her with my co-author, Marcus Kubsch (who also teaches high school physics) and a local teacher with whom I have collaborated (for many years), Alex Edwards.

The article is a nice encapsulation of what we've been writing and thinking about - and, Alex's words suggest that we should next carry out some empirical research on approaches to science teaching and learning that embrace uncertainty. The article is titled *Teaching Students to Understand the Uncertainties of Science Could Help Build Public Trust* and it is available here from EdWeek: https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/teaching-students-to-understand-the-uncertainties-of-science-could-help-build-public-trust/2022/07

Thanks to my co-authors Marcus, E.-J., and Mine for collaborating on this - much of the good ideas in this paper come from them.
