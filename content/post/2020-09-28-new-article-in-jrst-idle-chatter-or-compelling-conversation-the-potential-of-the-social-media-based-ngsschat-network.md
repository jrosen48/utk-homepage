This article is a long-time coming, and is one I'm very proud of. It is a social network analysis of the #NGSSchat network, one which involved qualitatively coding 1000s of posts sent to the hashtag (and 100s of profiles of those who posted to the network) and using multi-level *selection* models (and models for social *influence* processes) to show what most people who have participated in #NGSSchat know: It's a good place to learn and share about science education and the new science education standards. 

An abstract for the article, *Idle chatter or compelling conversation? The potential of the social media‐based #NGSSchat network for supporting science education reform efforts*, is here:

> The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) chat (#NGSSchat) is a social media‐based professional network used to discuss topics related to the NGSS in the United States. While successful reforms involve and coordinate the work of multiple stakeholders, recent research points out a striking lack of coordination between the individuals working in different educational roles—to the detriment of intended changes in the system. In this study, we analyzed more than 7,000 posts from individuals participating in #NGSSchat on Twitter (n = 247) during 2 years of 1‐hr synchronous discussions. We studied the depth and types of conversations that took place, the extent to which the involvement of teachers, administrators, researchers, and organizations was balanced, and what explains participation in the network over time. Using a mixed‐methods approach involving social network analysis, we found that conversations were primarily transactional, or social, and substantive, or providing opportunities for sense‐making about the standards or for participants to transform their practice and that individuals from diverse roles participated, with teachers comprising the plurality of those involved. Additionally, researchers, administrators, and teachers were the most active in the network, with no differences in both initiating, or sending, and being the recipients of, or receiving, replies as a part of conversations. Finally, we found that being a teacher or administrator, as well as receiving replies from individuals who were important in the network, were positively related to sustained involvement in the network in the following year. We discuss how #NGSSchat—as a social media‐based professional network—demonstrates similar features in other effective networks, and how social media‐based networks invite new visions for how to implement ambitious, large‐scale changes in science education.

I have a little bit more to say :)

First, thanks to my awesome co-authors Josh, Elizabeth, Matt, Christian, and T.J. 

Also, thank you to Tricia Shelton and Fred Ende for organizing this professional network; without them, and all of those who have moderated and participated in #NGSSchat, our study would definitely not have been possible.

Finally, I want to thank Naomi Waight, the special issue editor (with Knut Neumann), and the reviewers for helping us to make this a better study and article.

The article is a part of a special issue on *science teaching, learning, and assessment with 21st century, cutting‐edge digital ecologies*.
