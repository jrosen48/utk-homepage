[Enilda Romero-Hall](https://www.enildaromero.net/) edited the book [*Research Methods in Learning Design and Technology (LDT)*](https://www.researchmerge.com/), which was recently published by Routledge (available for purchase [here](https://www.routledge.com/Research-Methods-in-Learning-Design-and-Technology/Romero-Hall/p/book/9780367203283?fbclid=IwAR1h9GRcYav8evb0VzS7kIyrPtQihopzITxYbY5cUx4LLIqW9ANFWT3ixmc)). 

I co-wrote a chapter led by Spencer Greenhalgh on considerations for using social media data in LDT research (available open-access from the book site [here](http://www.researchmerge.com/uploads/7/5/3/5/75356681/chapter_5_research_methods_in_learning_design_and_technology_pre-print.pdf)).

I also wrote a chapter on making data science count in and for education with Michael Lawson, Daniel Anderson, Seth Jones, and Teya Rutherford. Here is [a link to a pre-print for the data science chapter](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post-prints/rosenberg-et-al-making-data-science-count.pdf). The abstract is below:

> New data sources and analytic techniques have enabled educational researchers to ask new
questions and work to address enduring problems, yet there are challenges to those learning and
applying these methods. In this chapter, we provide an overview of a nascent area of both
scholarship and teaching, educational data science. We define educational data science as the
combination of capabilities related to quantitative methods in educational research, computer
science and programming capabilities, and teaching, learning, and educational systems. We
demonstrate that there are two distinct—but complementary—perspectives on educational data
science, in terms of being both in education (as a research methodology) and for education (as a
teaching and learning content). We describe both of these areas in light of foundational and
recent research. Lastly, we highlight three future directions for educational data science,
emphasizing the synergies between these two perspectives concerning designing tools that can be
used by both learners and professionals, foregrounding representation, inclusivity, and access as
first-order concerns for those involved in the growing community, and using data science
methodologies to study teaching and learning about data science. We highlight the potential for
the growth of educational data science within Learning, Design, and Technology as situated with
the wider data science domain and in education more broadly.

I think the chapter makes a few contributions. One is trying to offer a definition - specific to education - of data science. Another is that it (aims) to bring together literature from two different (both nascent) fields, data science research methods and data science education.
