Today is the Autumnal Equinox --- one of two days on which the sunrise and sunset are around 12 hours apart around the world (_humble former science teacher note_: it's actually not 100% clear to me why it's not _precisely_ 12 hours apart). From here through the Winter Solstice, on December 21st, the period of daylight will be getting shorter, but at a slower rate each day. Thus, for me, today is both an optimistic and a pessimistic day. It's about to get darker; we're approaching winter. But, no longer will it be getting darker at a faster rate each day; we're approaching the point at which days will be getting longer again. In short: Happy Autumnal Equinox. I hope it is a good, healthy fall and winter that lies ahead for all of us.
