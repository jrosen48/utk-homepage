There has been a lot of productive discussion around open education research (or [science](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858418787466)). 

Lately, I've noticed some examples of what I think are good open education research. 

Though I think of these as good examples and models for the rest of us to follow, I think some of them are not always appreciated as such. This matters because open education research can then seem like something that is not relevant or too onerous. But, perhaps individual, small steps are even more important than making one big one.

As a quick caveat, these are just a few examples I've come across and (partially selfishly!) want to record so I can return to them later, and others might have different, important examples that I have missed. As another caveat, some of these aren't so little, but rather are simply good examples of open education research; I'm thinking about them in this context of good examples that are practical here and now.

### Blogging

As someone not in but adjacent to computer science education, Katie Rich's blog posts are my best source of the most recent developments in the field.

### Sharing What Others are Presenting at a Conference

Because of Enrique Suárez's live-tweeting of National Association for Research in Science Teaching, National Science Teachers Association, and American Education Research Association sessions, I felt like I was right there. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very excited to see <a href="https://twitter.com/educatordeb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@educatordeb</a> present on this work here at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSTA19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NSTA19</a>. I&#39;m going to be live-tweeting the session. If you&#39;re still looking for a place to go, this is it!

Bdong Chen shared a series of reports on the Learning Analytics and Knowledge conference that also made me feel like I was right there - and made me want to attend in the future.

### Sharing One's Own Conference Presentations

Again, helping with my FOMO, Phillip Bell and colleagues (including Enrique Suárez, again, and other collaborators) shared slides and resources associated with National Science Teachers Association workshops and presentations.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PLS RT <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NGSSchat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NGSSchat</a>—Here are links to all slides &amp; resources from my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSTA19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NSTA19</a> sessions<br>Assessment <a href="https://t.co/pC2oJoy977">https://t.co/pC2oJoy977</a><br>Teacher Resources <a href="https://t.co/XLjKJCl7I4">https://t.co/XLjKJCl7I4</a><br>Equity&amp;Justice <a href="https://t.co/pWq2qnuJxv">https://t.co/pWq2qnuJxv</a><br>Family STEAM <a href="https://t.co/1RcWnCT745">https://t.co/1RcWnCT745</a><br>Diverse Sense-Making <a href="https://t.co/tet8tLkg2U">https://t.co/tet8tLkg2U</a> <a href="https://t.co/vzxdt8pd5k">pic.twitter.com/vzxdt8pd5k</a></p>&mdash; Philip Bell (@philiplbell) <a href="https://twitter.com/philiplbell/status/1117536458078851074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2019</a></blockquote>

Sharing a picture of a poster can be helpful to others interested in the topic (see Mark Warschauer's response to Emily, and Emily's response to Mark with a link to the file on Google Drive!).

### Sharing Lessons and Activities

Sharing lessons and activities for students that teachers (such as pre-service teachers in teaching methods classes) create makes it possible for others to use (and learn from) good examples of the kind of work that I want to do more.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check out community STEAM activities from past groups of prospective teachers. <a href="https://t.co/vAXlMyTyEm">https://t.co/vAXlMyTyEm</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iteachmath?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iteachmath</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTBoS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTBoS</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CommunitySTEAM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CommunitySTEAM</a></p>&mdash; Frances Harper (@worldmathprobs) <a href="https://twitter.com/worldmathprobs/status/1111676103033278467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2019</a></blockquote>

### Including Information in Presentations About How to Access Data

Sarah Karamarkovich and Teya Rutherford shared a link to their presentation that included information about who to contact to hear more about the study (including about the statistical code needed to carry out the analysis) and who to contact to request access to the data. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Loved talking and learning about the complexity of motivation! <a href="https://twitter.com/DrTeyaR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DrTeyaR</a> and I looked at patterns of motivation throughout the school year.

### Sharing Ideas Related to In-Progress Studies

In addition to sharing information related to data analyses, many decisions are made while studies are in-progress. Lynn Hodge shared photographs, insights, and interpretation related to classroom research and interpreting students' (very cool) work.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Data visualizations about 4th grade preferences: drinks and favorite way to spend free time. Thoughts from session 6: Additive and multiplicative reasoning; size, shape, and symbol considerations. <a href="https://twitter.com/utkceems?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@utkceems</a> <a href="https://t.co/ipd7E7DGYb">pic.twitter.com/ipd7E7DGYb</a></p>&mdash; Lynn Liao Hodge (@LynnLHodge) <a href="https://twitter.com/LynnLHodge/status/1104040453593288709?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2019</a></blockquote>

There are certainly many other (great) examples that I didn't include and that I'd like to
