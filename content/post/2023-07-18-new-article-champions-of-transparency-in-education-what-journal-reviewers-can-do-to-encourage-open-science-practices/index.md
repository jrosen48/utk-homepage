I contributed to an article on how peer reviewers can take small steps to encourage the authors of manuscripts (and editors, indirectly) to encourage open science practices.

The paper is with Rachel Renbarger, Jill Adelson, Sondra Stegenga, Olivia Lowrey, Pamela Buckley, and Qiyang Zhang.

**Champions of Transparency in Education: What Journal Reviewers Can Do to Encourage Open Science Practices**

> As the field of education, and especially gifted education, gradually moves toward open science, our research community increasingly values transparency and openness brought by open science practices. Yet, individual researchers may be reluctant to adopt open science practices due to low incentives, barriers of extra workload, or lack of support to apply these in certain areas, such as qualitative research. We encourage and give guidelines to reviewers to champion open science practices by warmly influencing authors to consider applying open science practices to quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research and providing ample support to produce higher-quality publications. Instead of imposing open science practices on authors, we advocate reviewers suggest small, non-threatening, specific steps to support authors without making them feel overwhelmed, judged, or punished. We believe that these small steps taken by reviewers will make a difference to create a more supportive environment for researchers to adopt more open science practices.
