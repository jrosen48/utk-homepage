# Background 

This post includes some K-5 *computing education* (or *computer science education* or *computational thinking*- or *coding*-focused) resources. I'll use the term computing education in this post to refer to these terms, recognizing that there are distinctions between them that matter a great deal for many purposes. This list is just a starting point and it is not exhaustive; there are likely better compendia; and, this is a new(ish) area for me. While these were motivated by a review of resources related to K-5 computing education, many of them are designed/intended to be used by teachers and students across grades K-12. **This is really a draft** and I welcome additions, clarifications, and any other improvements that anyone suggests to this; reach out to me on Twitter ([@jrosenberg6432](https://twitter.com/jrosenberg6432)) or by email (jmrosenberg AT utk dot edu).
