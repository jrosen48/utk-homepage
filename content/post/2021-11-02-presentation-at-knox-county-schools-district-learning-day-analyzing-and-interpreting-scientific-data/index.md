With Aaron Reedy, I worked with Knox County Schools teachers on the practice of analyzing and interpreting scientific data. 

*Presenters*: Joshua Rosenberg (University of Tennessee) and Aaron Reedy (DataClassroom)
 
*Session Title*: Analyzing and Interpreting Scientific Data With DataClassroom
 
*Description*: While there are many technology tools that are suitable for analyzing and interpreting scientific data, not all are ideal for teaching and learningâ€”especially science teaching and learning. In this session, we will introduce some general strategies you can use to help your students to analyze and interpret data regardless of the tool you use. Then, we will provide an overview of the DataClassroom app for analyzing and interpreting scientific data in science classrooms (https://dataclassroom.com/), with a focus on uusing the app and planning how you will use it with your students.
