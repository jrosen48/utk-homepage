My colleagues Elizabeth Schultheis, Melissa Kjelvik, Aaron Reedy, and Omiya Sultana and my article, *Big data, big changes? The technologies and sources of data used in science classrooms*, was published in the *British Journal of Educational Technology*. This work involved surveying more than 300 science teachers---predominantly but not exclusively users of the [Data Nuggets](https://datanuggets.org/) resources that Elizabeth and Melissa have developed and the [DataClassroom](https://about.dataclassroom.com/) tool Aaron developed. 

Here's the short take-away from quantitative (descriptive) and qualitative analyses: **Teachers predominantly involve their students in analysing relatively small data sets that they collect. In support of this work, teachers tend to use the technologies that are available to themâ€”namely, calculators and spreadsheets. In addition, we found that a subset of teachers used a wide variety of data sources of varying complexity.**

I think this work provides a baseline for efforts to support science teachers' use of complex data in their science classrooms. That's to say, look for more on this topic! Elizabeth, Melissa, and Aaron and I are collaborating on several projects and Omiya is carrying out additional qualitative analyses to pursue a NARST conference proposal submission. I'm proud of this work and thankful for the collaborations.
