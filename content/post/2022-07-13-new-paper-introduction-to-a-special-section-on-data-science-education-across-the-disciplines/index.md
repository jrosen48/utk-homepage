More than a year ago, Shiyan Jiang and Victor Lee and I came together and chose to propose a special section on _data science education across disciplines_ (like a special issue, but slightly different, and primarily for journals that are online only). We wrote a proposal that was accepted and then shared a call for papers ([here](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/BJET%20Special%20Section%20CFP%20-%20Data%20Science%20Education%20Across%20the%20Disciplines-1628692058447.pdf)). The central tenet was that there is a need for (and value in) understanding and supporting teaching and learning data science across fields - not only in, for instance, mathematics education settings, but also in science and even English/language arts and art education contexts.

Following a long and winding road - it's been challenging during the pandemic - the special issue wrapped up, and Shiyan, Victor, and I wrote a (short) introduction to the special topic: why we think it was needed and what authors wrote that was included in the special issue. This introduction to the special section is available (free to access) here: https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.13258. I's a brief but I think a nice paper and I can't wait to share more about the special section and the papers in it when the special section is officially published.
