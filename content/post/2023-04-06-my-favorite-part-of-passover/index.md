I think my favorite part of Passover - the Jewish holiday that focuses on the Jews escape or emancipation from slavery in ancient Egypt, followed by their exodus in the Sinai desert - is about an expression of gratitude. There's a song, dayenu, that means (and is about) "it would have been enough". What's enough? This question is so hard to answer. What if I have an incredible life partner? A family I love; a job I like? There's always the desire for more: a child, another child, a better job, a better house, greater balance. Any of the good things in my life alone would have been enough. Dayenu! It helps that I have good memories of an Aunt and my mom singing this song loudly and that I was able to do the same last night with my family and with friends, too. Dayenu.
