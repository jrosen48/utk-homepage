I was interviewed for a short news update for Tennessee News Service on my study of [how school's posts on Facebook could threaten student privacy](https://theconversation.com/school-posts-on-facebook-could-threaten-student-privacy-160248) that was shared on public radio in Tennessee. Audio for the story is here: https://www.publicnewsservice.org/cuts/75/rss-75345-1.mp3
