A colleague shared [this article, *Requieum for the Spartans*](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/michigan-state-university-mass-shooting-campus/673060/) by an MSU graduate (now a journalist). It is good and worth reading. 

It makes the case that college is a gift, but that MSU is now a different place. It resonated with me as I was thinking over the past few days about how my time there feels like a meditation or a dream in retrospect, repetitive and tedious in the best possible way, like how weathering can turn a rock into something special.
