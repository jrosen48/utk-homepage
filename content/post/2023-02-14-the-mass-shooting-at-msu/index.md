When I heard that a man shot and killed [three Michigan State University students](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2023/02/14/michigan-state-university-shooting-victims-brian-fraser-alexandria-verner/69903314007/) in the Student Union, I thought of the time I spent in that building. Absurdly, I remember filling my presentation poster's tube with snacks at the end of the CREATE for STEM mini-conference there. I also remember getting my graduation hood and robe sized; absurdly for a different reason, I remember how my initials were incorrectly embroidered on the robe as "RHM". I contacted the store, was asked to send the robe back, and then received a package in the mail with the same initials embroidered: "RHM".

I grew into who I am in Lansing. I became more disciplined, focused, and honest. My wife and I had our son while we lived there. I can't think about MSU without thinking about some of the happiest times of my life. So, hearing about the mass shooting that occurred there brings back those feelings and a deep sadness about what this event will do the students and staff and wider community; the kids whose lives were lost means that the lives of many others are changed, too. I don't know else what to say about the mass shooting, except that this shouldn't happen.
