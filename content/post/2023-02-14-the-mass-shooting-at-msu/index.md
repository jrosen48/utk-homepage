When I heard that a man shot and killed [three Michigan State University students](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2023/02/14/michigan-state-university-shooting-victims-brian-fraser-alexandria-verner/69903314007/) in the Student Union, I thought of the time I spent in that building---one of the two where students were shot. Absurdly, I remember filling my presentation poster's tube with snacks at the end of the CREATE for STEM mini-conference there. I also remember getting my graduation hood and robe sized; absurdly for a different reason, I remember how my initials were incorrectly embroidered on the robe as "RHM". I contacted the store, was asked to send the robe back, and then received a package in the mail with the same initials embroidered: "RHM".

I grew into who I am in Lansing. I became more disciplined, focused, and honest. My wife and I had our son while we lived there. I can't think about MSU without thinking about some of the happiest times of my life. So, hearing about the mass shooting that occurred there brings back those feelings and a deep sadness about what this event will do the students and staff and wider community; the kids whose lives were lost means that the lives of many others are changed, too. I don't know else what to say about the mass shooting, except that this shouldn't happen.

I listened to [Lord Huron](https://www.lordhuron.com/) more than any other musical artist in Michigan. Their music isn't generally super dark, but [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBy2qRG1PA0) is, and it seems appropriate today.

> I took a little journey to the unknown  
> And I've come back changed, I can feel it in my bones  
> I fucked with forces that our eyes can't see  
> Now the darkness got a hold on me  
> Oh, the darkness got a hold on me  
> How long baby have I been away?  
> Oh, it feels like ages, though you say it's only days  
> There ain't language for the things I've seen, yeah  
> And the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams  
> The truth is stranger than all my dreams  
> Oh, the darkness got a hold on me  

Sending well wishes and peace to those grieving.
