To share in [a neat and fairly-comprehensive proposal library from my institution](https://research.utk.edu/proposal-support/toolkit/proposal-library/), I gather materials for the [National
Science Foundation Building Capacity in STEM Education Research program](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20521/nsf20521.htm) proposal
I submitted last June ([post here](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/posts/new-project-understanding-the-development-of-interest-in-computer-science/)). 

The library had examples from a number of disciplines (and for a number of funders), but did not have any for educational research.

I shared the following materials:

- Summary
- Narrative
- References (in a separate file from the narrative)
- Budget justification
- Questions for clarification I was asked during the review process
- Responses to the questions for clarification
- Post-doc mentoring plan
- Facilities and other resources description
- Data management plan

They're compiled in this document: [rosenberg-nsf-bcser-proposal.pdf](/grants/nsf-bcser-proposal-rosenberg.pdf)

The grant writing process was initially shrouded in mystery for me, and the help
I received from others was invaluable, and I hope this serves as one source of 
help for those interested.
