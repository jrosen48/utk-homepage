To share in a university repository, I compiled the materials for the [National
Science Foundation Building Capacity in STEM Education Research program](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20521/nsf20521.htm) proposal
I submitted last year (which was [awarded; see this post](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/posts/new-project-understanding-the-development-of-interest-in-computer-science/))

The materials include the:

- Summary
- Narrative
- References (in a separate file from the narrative)
- Budget justification
- Questions for clarification I was asked during the review process
- Responses to the questions for clarification
- Post-doc mentoring plan
- Facilities and other resources description
- Data management plan
