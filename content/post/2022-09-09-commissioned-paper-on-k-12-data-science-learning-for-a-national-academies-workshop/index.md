I had blogged a few weeks ago about a [National Academies workshop on K-12 data science education](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/08/20/national-academies-workshop-on-data-science-education-dse-call-for-dse-challenges/); briefly the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics is planning a workshop on Data Science Education on September 13-14. The workshop is in-person and online; you can register to attend it [here](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/09-13-2022/foundations-of-data-science-for-students-in-grades-k-12-a-workshop-days-1-and-2).

I co-authored one of four commissioned papers on K-12 data science learning. That paper and three others are available from the [homepage for the workshop](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/09-13-2022/foundations-of-data-science-for-students-in-grades-k-12-a-workshop-days-1-and-2). The paper I co-authored with Ryan ("Seth") Jones is titled [*A Secret Agent? K-12 Data Science Learning Through the Lens of Agency*](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/09-13-2022/docs/DD667E469D0EC5DD91A7D85BC839A9852491A3CF9F15); the other three are on critical data literacy, the national landscape of K-12 data science education implementation, and tools and technologies to support data science in K-12 education.
