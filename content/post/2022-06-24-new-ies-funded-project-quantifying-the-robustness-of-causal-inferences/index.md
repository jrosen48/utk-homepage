This project is still a ways off from starting, but I'm beginning a new IES-funded methodological project. This work is on quantifying the robustness of causal inferences in educational research. It builds on work that Ken Frank at Michigan State University did to develop a widely-used approach for doing just that: quantifying how sensitive an inference about an effect is to sources of bias. My role on this work has been to develop statistical software, including the [konfound](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/konfound/index.html) R package and [Konfound-It!](http://konfound-it.com/) Shiny app. I like to stay sharp methodologically and I like this approach, having used it in several papers (i.e., [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-018-0814-9) and [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131520300117?via%3Dihub) paper).

I also like the team and am excited that an outstanding doctoral student here at UTK with unsurpassable R chops, [Sarah Narvaiz](https://www.sarahnarvaiz.com/), has agreed to work on the project for the next year.
