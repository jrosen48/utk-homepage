This spring and the beginning of summer (and this year) feels impossible to
summarize.

It started off a little personally tumultuous; beginning in October (of last
year), our little one started to get colds---we think from daycare. In
mid-December, he had an ear infection, which started one of the most challening
(in the context of everything *ultimately* being alright---we were safe, cared
for, and we had our jobs/incomes) periods... at least of adulthood. I can't
clearly say whether it looks better or worse looking back, but the little
basically had ear infections constantly. He would take an antibiotic, feel
better within one or two days, be fine for around another week, and, then,
within a few days (and, in a few cases, a day) of stopping the antibiotics, he
became sick again.

He had something like six ear infections during the December, 2019-March, 2020
period. Little missed a lot of daycare and we missed a ton of work. We were also
constantly sick; my wife became more sick than she'd been since college (we
think it was the flu). While I have been lucky to have taken antibiotics once in
the last decade (when I was teaching). I think I had the flu. Weekends felt as
hard as weekdays, and we didn't see any family between the end of winter break
and mid-March.

Then . . .

Well, then, our little one had a tubes surgery. It was scheduled for April, but
we were lucky to have it be moved to March, and, then, right when the pandemic
was beginning, from a Monday (when the CDC was releasing---and then
released---guidance to doctor's to not carry out elective surgeries, including
tubes surgery) to a Thursday. The surgery itself was a breeze. I wrote a post on
it [here](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/posts/sickness-and-gratitude/). This was
a big deal to me and to us.

Around the same time, I was scheduled to travel to Portland for the SIGSCE
conference^[the conference was eventually cancelled the day it began,
[oye](https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/attendees/health-info.html)]; at the last
minute, between being sick, caring for the little one, and being very concerned
about the pandemic, I decided to cancel the trip.

Then the pandemic started. We were so lucky to have had the little one's surgery
before; it would have been four-six weeks, otherwise. And, then, my parents
visited, after which the pandemic became much worse. So, they stayed with us for
a month. And, the little one was healthy, we rested, spent time together, and
tried to make sense of things. My parents eventually left (for Michigan - where
things had finally become better), and, we had a few quiet weeks. It was a weird
combination of a sweet time with a stressful national and international
catastrophe. Somewhere in between all of this, my co-authors and I sent our book
to our publisher and finished revisions for a long worked on article.

Then, George Floyd was murdered, and a personal period of learning, discussion,
and the beginning of action. My wife began a pretty intense summer course schedule for her
Information Sciences graduate program, including a four-week mini-term class. I
wasn't (and am not) teaching, but things felt like they somehow picked up pace,
with a conference, a weeklong teacher PD, another conference, and a one-day workshop. Research
on other projects, especially those wth students working and/or with time to
dedicate in the summer, accelerated. I was involved in service for a section of
an AERA Division and was reviewing manuscripts.

And . . . this sort of brings me to back to the impossibility of summarizing
this year. In a few words, so far, this year has been---roughly in this order:

- sick  
- disordered 
- relieving
- overwhelming  
- sad  
- sweet  
- revealing  
- inspiring  
- stressful  
- exhausting

The personal and collective feel like they'be blended together this last year; 
maybe this is my circumstance. I've always felt like I deal well in stress (relaxing
is more of a challenge for me), but I've struggled, a bit, to make sense of my
place in the world and my experiences over the past few months. I won't try; I
will just share this as a way of reflecting on and documenting some of the past
six months or so. I will try to take a break over the next few weeks, before
fall begins. I know this past year has been *much* harder (in many cases,
unimaginably harder) on many than it has been for me (and my wife and little
one); actually, I'm lucky that words like "sweet" could make their way into my
thinking over these past six months, but time with family was that, and so for
that I feel grateful.
