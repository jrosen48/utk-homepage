I recently read Kubsch and colleague's (2021) paper in *Practical Assessment, Research, and Evaluation*, and it is revelatory. It only only introduces Bayesian 
statistical methods in the context of science education research, it shows: a) a case in which prior knowledge can be meaningfully brought to bear upon the analysis and b) how the use of a prior can be critiqued/compared with the effects of a less informative prior. It also compares the analysis to the frequentist approach nicely. I think this could be a foundational piece in science education research.

One question I have for the authors: I believe the outcome was created as a composite of individual items. Is it possible to model (measurement-related) uncertainty in this (latent) factor/construct using Bayes?
