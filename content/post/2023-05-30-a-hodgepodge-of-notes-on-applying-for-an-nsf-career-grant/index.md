# Introduction
I've spoken with two friends over the last few weeks about applying for an NSF CAREER grant, and I thought to share a few notes here, mostly so I can build on them and flesh this out at some point in the future (and so I don't lose them!). Here is [a recent blog post](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2023/04/30/new-post-nsf-career-project-credible/) on the project I'm starting this fall.

This is _really rough_, mostly just notes, and shared very humbly; I recognize the high degree of good luck I had in my proposal, and so please consider these notes with that foremost in mind.

One more note: Most of this applies to any NSF grant as much as it does to an NSF CAREER grant.

# Fundamental Points to Emphasize
- In terms of things to emphasize, make three things clear for reviewers, as being clear about these can help reviewers to understand and summarize your project:
    - What the need is. 
    - What you'll do. 
    - How you'll study it. 
    
- Write [a one-pager](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2023/04/04/before-and-after-i-first-started-to-think-about-the-core-idea-in-my-nsf-career-proposal/) and share this early and often

- Minor, but important for reviewers: Focus the intellectual merit section (around one lengthy paragraph) on the rationale and need for the project. 
    - Also, focus the broader impacts section on specific, unique ways the project will positively impact people and the wider society or world

- Speaking to a program officer early to determine suitability for the program and the scope and details of the project is essential 

# Structural Recommendations
- At the beginning of the proposal, it is important to convince reviewers of the need (in the first few paragraphs/first page)--or, for reviewers who might not immediately buy the need, it is important to persuade them over the first few pages
- At the end, structure the writing so that the narrative doesn't peter out at the end, but builds to a strong conclusion
- The rhetorical element is important; having the document be readable as a whole (and not just consisting of a collection of sections)

# Additional Suggestions
- Know the audience in terms of what kinds of things reviewers for the specific program are likely to prioritize and value
- Speaking to size and program explicitly in the proposal can help reviewers
- Hedge your bets; for example, if the proposal is primarily quantitative, add a substantial (though not focal) qualitative element
- Know what your weaknesses (in the proposal or as a PI) are and argue against them in the proposal (not necessarily explicitly so as to call attention to them, but by subtly addressing potential critiques in the project design or just in the writing)
- This part is at least a little specific to the CAREER: have a clear, singular focus, but make progress along that focus in several ways / at multiple levels (this can be tricky to navigate; at least, it was for me!)
- Plan to submit multiple times (at least as an expectation)
