Several friends shared with me storyies about their struggles with having children after I shared yesterday about my wife Katie's miscarriage yesterday ([here](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/10/12/tragedy-and-experiencing-loss/)). These were challenges with infertility, miscarriage, and difficult births. There are others, too. It was heartbreaking; not in some saint-like - but rather in a clarifying - way, it is hard to read about the loss and heartache of others. Two comments stuck out; both were from friends who described their experiences as the hardest and darkest days of their lives. I was not unaware of these struggles, but I am more aware now, and I wonder there is more to be gained from sharing a bit more about these experiences to feel (and help others feel) less alone.
