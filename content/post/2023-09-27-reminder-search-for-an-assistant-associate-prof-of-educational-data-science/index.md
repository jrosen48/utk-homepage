I thought this morning to just post a reminder for those who may have not yet seen the advertisement about the search for an Assistant or Associate Professor of Educational Data Science at my institution.

The position description and information on applying can be found at this link: https://apply.interfolio.com/129607

Broadly, we are trying to build a world-class data science team. The search is broad and part of a three faculty member cluster hire. I hope interested candidates from a wide variety of disciplines, locations, backgrounds, and career stages apply.

Please reach out with questions or suggestions of applicants to contact.
