When my fam and I moved to Knoxville, I began to explore the outdoors options around the city. I ended up, of course, reading about Great Smoky Mountains National Park, in addition to the Cumberland Mountains. In the course of this research, I learned about the Adventure Archives YouTube channel - they had taken a rainy hike in the Smokies several years back---two more since. 

I loved their latest video so much that I wanted to support them, almost buying a t-shirt before realizing... I don't need another t-shirt. So instead I am blogging about them here. If interested in the outdoors, check out one of the videos (consider seeing if they've hiked somewhere nearby) here https://www.youtube.com/c/AdventureArchives
