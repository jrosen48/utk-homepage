I have been peppering my recent posts with religious elements---but not speaking to religion directly. In this post, I'll speak to religion directly.

Last night, my wife and I said thanks for our (sick with a nasty virus!) child. We also expressed thanks for the growing child in Katie's belly for doing well in there. These expressions of thanks were a way to make an everyday Friday night special.

Over the last few weeks, I have also been almost overwhelmed with gratitude. I have a life full of gifts, but these last few weeks have been extra special.

These two things---making the everyday special and experiencing gratitude---may not typically be considered to be religious expressions, but I am claiming them as such... partially based upon [this lovely book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/358136.To_Life) but also based on feeling like they are real. **Making the everyday special and being grateful**. Not more, but not less---and not exclusionary and hurtful as religion (Judaism and other religions, too) can all too often be.
