This has been a week of loss and reflecting on loss, a hard one without a respite apart from in the comfort of family and friends. Before this week, I was listening to the [Watchhouse song titled Echo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3VtlYjDmFM), and it is _more_ appropriate for this week. It is a sad song, with no comfort apart from that offered by experiencing the sadness as it comes. I'll note - my family and I are safe and well - so don't worry about us!

Well I try to close my eyes
Clear my mind
Just listen to the wildflowers grow
Such whispers on the breeze
It don't come easy now
Over all this noise

Spent my youth among the pine
They used to sing a tune so fine
And the wind moved like an echo
Carryin' their voices

And I saw it in a dream
Monuments to trees
As the air we breathe turned our lungs to dust
And the redwoods so tall
And all their awe
Began to rust

With no bend and sway at all
That ancient dance is lost
And the wind moved like an echo
With a sigh in every gust

Well some day I hope to find
That land of honey wine
Where the coffee grows on the white oak trees
And those sugar coated mountains
In the spring begin to melt into
Sweetest streams

Where each night the starlight and the sea
Together form eternity
And the wind moves like an echo
As the world drops off to sleep
