This has been a week of loss and reflecting on loss, a hard one without
a respite apart from in the comfort of family and friends. Before this
week, I was listening to the [Watchhouse song titled
Echo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3VtlYjDmFM), and it is *more*
appropriate for this week. It is a sad song, with no comfort apart from
that offered by experiencing the sadness as it comes. I'll note - my
family and I are safe and well - so don't worry about us!

> Well I try to close my eyes
>
> Clear my mind
>
> Just listen to the wildflowers grow
>
> Such whispers on the breeze
>
> It don't come easy now
>
> Over all this noise
>
> Spent my youth among the pine
>
> They used to sing a tune so fine
>
> And the wind moved like an echo
>
> Carryin' their voices
