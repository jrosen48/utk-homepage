*This is something like Part 3 of 3 (or, maybe Part 3 of more!). Here are [Part 1](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/04/26/presentation-at-the-lead-graduate-school-and-research-network-retreat/) and [Part 2](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/04/28/reflections-on-traveling-to-germany/), neither long.*

I'm journeying home from Germany after a week away from home. It was an enriching trip, educational, enjoyable, even a bit restful (though I miss my son and wife very much).

I'm going to keep this one short, mostly because I'm quite tired. Some reflections:

- Traveling can be an incredible way to learn; what I learned in a week about Germany and Europe (and their history), food, and myself is hard to sum
- I am not really into museums, and I think that is okay; what I learned the most from were: ordering bread at bakeries; asking butchers which sausage are good for hiking; going to a football game; walking around a beautiful city around 5:00 pm
- I think the learning-related elements of travel can be augmented by reading (or watching videos about) about the region and country one to which one is traveling

Maybe this is due to COVID, but I can hardly recall a more rewarding week of travel. Thanks once more to my cousin in Munich, my friend who invited me, and my wife and mother-in-law who made the trip possible.
