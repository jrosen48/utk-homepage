Around 2015, my wife and I didn't leave Lansing, Michigan, during the winter break. It was cold, snowy, dark, and one of the best and most special breaks I remember. It was a time of quiet reflection, much like this winter break when my family didn't leave (Knoxville, Tennessee). 

I am still basking in the quiet (and the cold --- and the pretty dark evenings!). I found this song by one of my favorite groups, Mandoling Orange, on YouTube and it captured my current mood. It is perfection!
