Based on several conversations and ideas from friends, I copy-pasted several recent blog posts into chatGPT with a prompt like the following: *Please write a Haiku based on the following blog post:* (followed by the entire unedited text of the post).

(Aside: What's chatGPT? [Here is a decent overview](https://apnews.com/article/what-is-chat-gpt-ac4967a4fb41fda31c4d27f015e32660) with a focus on education)

I first used a predecessor of chatGPT, GPT-3, in April as part of [a presentation on ML and AI ](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/04/26/presentation-at-the-lead-graduate-school-and-research-network-retreat/) at the LEAD Graduate School at the University of Tuebingen.

Here, I'll pick three more or less random posts, sharing the first result after using a slightly modified prompt: *Please write a Haiku based on the following blog post in the style of Bashō: *. 

Here goes. I'll link to the blog post instead of posting its entire text.

[**Reflecting on the last year**](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2023/01/01/reflecting-on-the-last-year/)

> Challenges bloomed
Humbling growth in mind and faith
Joy and sorrow mix

[**Tearing down goal posts was not cool**](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/10/17/tennessee-should-not-allow-students-to-tear-down-goal-posts/)

> Victory cheers ring out
Fans rush the field in joy
But let's celebrate right

[**Why it can be hard to understand the Smokies (and a bit on my understanding of them)**](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2021/08/21/a-bunch-of-thoughts-on-the-tennessee-side-of-the-great-smoky-mountains-national-park/)

> Nature's symphony
Smokies' silence speaks loudest
Peace found within stillness

How are they? Not... bad, but not quite right in these three cases.
