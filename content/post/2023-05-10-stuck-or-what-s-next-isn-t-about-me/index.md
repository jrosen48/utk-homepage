Spotify creates a year-end playlist of my most-played songs for the previous year, and revisiting what I listened to in 2016, 2017, and 2018 is fun and edifying for me. 

Looking back, I feel like I listened to music that was spunky and energetic - maybe I was too, you decide...

2019 and 2020 were different. They were hard. We moved, and looking back, we were lonely. Then COVID. Katie was in grad school, and I was also busting my butt at work, with weekdays and many weekends separate, punctuated by daycare closings, COVID illnesses, and not seeing friends and fam. 

At first it was workable...

Then it was not as workable, but we made it through...

For 2021 and 2022, I had the same song as my top song... meditative, hopeful, yearning even...

This process made me question what is next, and I think that I (and we) have been in limbo, waiting, hopeful, yearning, learning. 

So, what is next? I think it is not about me - it cannot be the same song three years in a row, can it be? I hope to learn from others' songs in the next year, moving on and past the past two and more years, happy and spunky,git  even.
