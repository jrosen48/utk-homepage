(ICLS)](https://icls2020.org) [Early Career Workshop](https://icls2020.org/apply-for-special-workshops/). 

It has been great. Kudos to the organizers for still carrying out the workshop virtually.

Part is presenting on an in-progress project; I'm presenting on a project that is
at a very early stage - trying to explore what role Bayesian methods may have for
K-2 science teaching and learning. I prepared a short presentation (below):
