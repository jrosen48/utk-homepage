I wrote a comment with my awesome colleagues Aaron Kessler and Rasheda Likely on open science in science education. The paper is titled **Open for whom? The need to define open science for science education**. The paper takes a constructively critical stance on open science, arguing that open science reforms need to advance in such a way that they meet the aims of the science education research--and the wider science education--communities/systems.
