I wrote a comment with my colleagues [Aaron Kessler](https://openlearning.mit.edu/about/our-team/aaron-kessler) and [Rasheda Likely](https://bagwell.kennesaw.edu/departments/eece/faculty/ece-faculty-index.php) on open science in science education. The paper is titled **Open for whom? The need to define open science for science education**. The paper takes a constructively critical stance on open science, arguing that open science reforms need to advance in such a way that they meet the aims of the science education research--and the wider science education--communities/systems.

This was rewarding to work on with Aaron and Rasheda and we hope this serves as a provocation for the field to consider how we define open science.
