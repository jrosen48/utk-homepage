In my mind, the winter break began around the Winter Solstice, when I blogged about [the joy in the year's shortest day](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/12/20/happy-winter-solstice/). Today feels sort of like the end of the winter break. I've been working more or less consistently, but the pace has been slower, interspersed with family time in a way that has felt good. The break was rocky, but suitably joyous, ending on a day when I feel thankful for the slow, quiet break filled with family time and time with good friends.

If joy was the song of winter break, what is the song of spring? I came across this song randomly on Spotify, later finding this live version on YouTube. A dad naturally playing music with his grown daughter. What could be better? What kind of unusual gift a family is. For mine near and far and the opportunity to pass time with them I am unusually grateful.
