The Proceedings from the National Academy of Science's *Foundations of Data Science for Students in Grades K-12* were published this week. They're available [here](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26852/foundations-of-data-science-for-students-in-grades-k-12). 

I blogged about the workshop previously [here](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/09/14/reflections-on-day-1-of-the-foundations-of-data-science-for-k-12-students-nasem-workshop/) and [here](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/09/09/commissioned-paper-on-k-12-data-science-learning-for-a-national-academies-workshop/). 

I hope these proceedings influence the conversation about K-12 data science education in the years ahead. Kudos to the organizers and editors of the proceedings.
