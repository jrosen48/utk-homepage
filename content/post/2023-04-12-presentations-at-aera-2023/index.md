Last night, I recollected that the last American Educational Research Association (AERA) conference I attended was four years ago - during April 2019 in Toronto, Canada. I remember walking down a busy road from my hotel to the location of a presentation when I received an email from the Taylor & Frances editor for *Data Science in Education Using R* indicating that they were moving to accept our proposal to publish the book - which was eventually published in October, 2020---this event approaching being three years ago! At the time of the last AERA, my son was just barely one year old! He is now five. This is all to say, it has been a long time since I last attended an AERA conference!

I've missed it a bit and I am looking forward to the conference this year. 

I am happy to be presenting on several projects I'm excited about.

## Other events

I am looking forward to a few other events. The *SEERnet* IES-funded project has a pre-conference advisory board meeting and the *Review of Educational Research* journal has an editorial review board meeting. There's a dinner for folks interested in data science education organized by the *Concord Consortium* and *Data Science for Everyone* and I hope to see and update several colleagues I haven't seen in *awhile*. On this note, if you're going to be at AERA and want to connect, please reach out. 

## *fin*

Next week is also the National Association for Research in Science Teaching (NARST) conference - one I haven't been to in even longer than AERA (more on that next week). For that conference, I am proud that two doctoral students I advise are presenting research; I am traveling to AERA alone this year. Related to both of these, I am only going to be at AERA for one night this year - I miss my family already.
