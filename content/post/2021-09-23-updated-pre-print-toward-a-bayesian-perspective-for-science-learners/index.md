With [Marcus Kubsch](https://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/en/the-ipn/departments/physics-education/staff/kubsch-marcus), [E.-J. Wagenmakers](https://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/professor-appointments/2012/05/dr-e-j-wagenmakers.html), and [Mine Dogucu](https://www.stat.uci.edu/faculty/mine-dogucu/), I've updated our pre-print that argues
that a Bayesian perspective can be used by science teachers and learners, especially when science
learners are engaged in reasoning / arguing / analyzing and interpreting data in light of uncertainty.

The pre-print--**Why and How a Bayesian Approach Supports Science Educators and Learners to Reason Under Scientific Uncertainty**--is here: https://osf.io/aznyq/

In this version, we focused on steps to make a Bayesian approach practical. Part of this is heuristics that can guide learners' involvement in several science practices:

- Always be open to new evidence  
- Account for what we already know  
- Consider alternative explanations  

We also created a Shiny app / widget that uses Bayes' rule under the hood to transform prior information and new evidence into an estimate of how likely a belief is. That is available here: https://kubsch.shinyapps.io/Confidence_Updater/

We welcome feedback on this work.
