*Data Science in Education Using R* co-author Isabella posted in RStudio Community
about a strange issue encountered when adding figure numbers to the book: they 
are regularly out of order. The post in RStudio Community is [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/bookdown-figure-numbers-out-of-order/56600)].

As one example, [in Chapter 5](https://datascienceineducation.com/c05.html), the figure numbering begins with 5.1 . . . 
but then proceeds to 0.1, and then picks up (correctly) with 5.3 through the 
last figure, 5.10. 

After trying to figure out whether there was an issue with that 
figure ([source code for Chapter 5](https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education/edit/master/05-foundational-skills_1.Rmd)),
we looked at other chapters, like [Chapter 9](https://datascienceineducation.com/c09.html), for which the numbering is even more dramatically out or order.

If you have any suggestions, please consider responding to [the RStudio Community post](https://community.rstudio.com/t/bookdown-figure-numbers-out-of-order/56600) or by messaging us at authors@datascienceineducation.com.
