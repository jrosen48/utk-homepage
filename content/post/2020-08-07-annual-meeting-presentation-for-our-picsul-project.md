We had our annual meeting for our [Pursuing Interest in Undergraduate Computer Science Learners (PICSUL)](http://picsul.utk.edu/) project. I've tried to share as much of the project in an 
open way as possible, including [all of the materials from the proposal](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2020/05/22/materials-for-nsf-bcser-proposal/).

In that spirit, a link to the presentation (Google Docs) is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19uPK9-dNsZ_ab7rsz6dndu8Z-g5-yo7Z/view?usp=sharing).
