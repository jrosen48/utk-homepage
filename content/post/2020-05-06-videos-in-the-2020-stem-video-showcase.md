My colleagues submitted videos to the [2020 STEM for All Video Showcase](https://stemforall2020.videohall.com/) for two
projects:

Theory-based Computational Analysis of Classroom Video:

Computer Science for Appalachia:
https://stemforall2020.videohall.com/presentations/1730

They're short (three minutes or less) and intended to provide an overview of 
their respective projects.
