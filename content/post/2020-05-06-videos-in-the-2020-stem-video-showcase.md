My colleagues submitted videos to the [2020 STEM for All Video Showcase](https://stemforall2020.videohall.com/) for two
projects:

Theory-based Computational Analysis of Classroom Video:

Computer Science for Appalachia:

They're short (three minutes or less) and intended to provide an overview of 
their respective projects. I'm proud of them and the work that went into them. 
Both projects are finishing their first year this summer, and so there will be
(a lot) that I hope to share over the coming years.

Also, viewing the other videos (from other federally-funded projects) is not a 
bad way to spend 30 minutes or so! One that stuck out to me was on the [music 
and coding](https://stemforall2020.videohall.com/presentations/1709).
