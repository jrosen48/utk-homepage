A new NSF-funded project led from start to finish by [Alex Lishinski](https://www.alexlishinski.com/) at UTK was awarded funding this week. This project involves designing and studying the use of self-assessment in undergraduate CS settings. A cool feature of the project is that it takes place at both UTK and PSSU, an outstanding community college with close relations with UTK. I'm excited to carry out this work and to see what we learn! Kudos to Alex for her intellectual (and practical) leadership of this work.
