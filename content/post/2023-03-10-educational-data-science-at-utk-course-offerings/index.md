The [Educational Data Science Graduate Certificate](https://volsonline.utk.edu/programs-degrees/educational-data-science-gc/) is off and running. There are several modifications in terms of the course codes (e.g., STEM 580 is now STEM 680) and names. The four courses that make up the certificate and when they will be offered are as follows:

- **STEM 680 Foundations of Educational Data Science I (3 credits)**: Every Fall  
- **STEM 685 Foundations of Educational Data Science II (3)**: Every Spring  
- **STEM 691 Visualizing Data Using R (3)**: Every Spring  
- **STEM 695 Capstone in Educational Data Science (3)**: Every other Fall (beginning Fall '24)  

If interested, please reach out! I think the program is off to a good start. The data visualization class has almost 30 students and is fun to teach; the other courses have provided a good foundation in learning how to use R and using R and RStudio as tools to make sense of a range of types fo data. I'm excited to offer the capstone in the near future.

You can apply for admission to the graduate certificate whether or not you are a student at UTK. Information on the application process is available [here](https://gradschool.utk.edu/forms-central/admission-to-graduate-certificate-program/), but you can also reach out to me at [mailto:jrosenb8@utk.edu] if you have questions about the program or applying.
