The [Educational Data Science Graduate Certificate](https://volsonline.utk.edu/programs-degrees/educational-data-science-gc/) is off and running. There are several modifications in terms of the course codes (e.g., STEM 580 is now STEM 680) and names. The four courses that make up the certificate and when they will be offered are as follows:

- **STEM 680 Foundations of Educational Data Science I (3 credits)**: Every Fall  
- **STEM 685 Foundations of Educational Data Science II (3)**: Every Spring  
- **STEM 691 Visualizing Data Using R (3)**: Every Spring  
- **STEM 695 Capstone in Educational Data Science (3)**: Every other Fall (beginning Fall '24)
