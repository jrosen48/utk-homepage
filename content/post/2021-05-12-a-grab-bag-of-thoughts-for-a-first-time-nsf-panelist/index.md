This is an informal post; as much a reflection as something that may actually be useful 
to others. This post is on some thoughts on being an NSF panelist for a review panel. 
It's written after having served on three panels - one face-to-face, and two online -
and feeling like I have _something_ to say, though I'm unsure what, just yet. Here goes...

1. It is common to hear this from others who have previously served on a review panel, but it
bears mentioning that it takes a lot of time! I think one rough way to estimate how much
time it will take is to consider each proposal that you will review to be comparable in the
time it will take to review as one journal article. Thus, the standard of refiewing
eight proposals would, by this token, be roughly comparable to reviewing eight journal articles.
In some ways, that's an over-estimate of how long the process of reviewing proposals will take, but
when all is said and done (reading the proposals, writing feedback, logistically preparing for and
learning about the program/review process, discussing the proposals, and writing summaries), it seems about
right. Try to plan accordingly!

2. Reviewing eight proposals can be overwhelming. Something I've found helpful is to first 
skim all eight and then to read the proposals more carefully, taking notes. After that, I find it 
helpful to write a rough sketch of a review with general thoughts - just to have something down on 
the page. Then, I'll read the proposal more carefully, adding specific observations/questions to 
the review.

3. The review does not need to be perfect at the time you submit (24 hours or the day 
before the panel); you will be discussing the proposal with other panelists, and it is 
most important to have a record of what you want to raise and discuss with others. You
can revise your review up until the end of the panel.

4. During the panel, you'll provide a brief overview (not an evaluation) of the proposals
for which you're the primary panelist; then, you'll provide your comments, then will take
notes on others' comments. The discussion is time to try to argue for the weaknesses of
proposals or to advocate for their strengths; it can be a dynamic and engaging conversation 
and part of the review process, one that can be important (or, to me, it feels that way!), to
whether a proposal will be recommended for funding. The result of this discussion is the panel
providing a rating of Highly Competitive, Competitive, or Not Competitive different from the
Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor ratings you individually provide. Proposals ranked below 
a certain cut-off (in terms of the individual ratings) are not discussed.

I think that's all I have for now; I'll add more to this later.
