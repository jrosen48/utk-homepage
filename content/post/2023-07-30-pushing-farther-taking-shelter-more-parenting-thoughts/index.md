## Pushing further

One of the most important events for me as a parent was when my neighbor, Zach, invited me to join him, his son, his friend, and his friend's daughter, on a camping trip. The location was Frozen Head State Park, Jonah had just turned two, and we had never camped before. More broadly, Katie had, simply and frankly, taken on more responsibilities as a parent than I had. Reasons indefensible or partially defensible, that was the case, and I am thankful that we addressed this since then.

I'll briefly recant the tale. We left for Frozen Head around lunchtime on a nice day in June; Jonah napped in the car, and as we arrived at the campground (and the playground next to the creek), he woke up, and, if I recall correctly, jumped, out, and started to play. He was already buds with Zach's son, and made quick friends with the daughter of Zach's friend, Mark. My primary memory of the trip is of the kids playing with toy cars and tractors and splashing in the creek. I was, of course, the only one responsible for many things I relied on Katie for: changing every diaper, figuring out how to keep Jonah from getting multiple changes of clothes wet, and so on---and the normal camping tasks of setting up the tent, mqking meals, and trying to keep clean and tidy.
