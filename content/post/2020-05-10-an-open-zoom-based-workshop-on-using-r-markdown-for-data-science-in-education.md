Like many things posted to the #rstats hashtag on Twitter, [a recent post 
requesting resources related to using R Markdown](https://twitter.com/jrosenberg6432/status/1258739495547080710) led to a number of helpful 
ones. The post was in the context of learning R and R Markdown for research-
related projects in education.

I shared many resources (and the post) with a graduate research assistant and thought about meeting one-on-one to review the resources - but, there are a few other students at my insitution who might also be interested, and there might be folks not at my institution who would be interested in following - or contributing to - a conversation about using R Markdown/R. I thought the best 
way to open the conversation up (and probably have a better one) is to have an 
open, Zoom-based conversation on the topic. So, here's a plan:

- This Friday, May 15, from noon - 1:00 pm EST, we'll meet to discuss using R Markdown
- The conversation will be situated in the context of educational research
- Roughly the first 40 minutes will involve working through an R Markdown document, from
creating to rendering one
- We'll use RStudio Cloud, so folks can get started with zero prerequisites
- Throughout, we'll draw on and refer to resources shared about R Markdown

This is thus especially for educational researchers/data analysts/scientists, though any one is welcome to join. 

Depending on interest (especially from students), I may try to carry out other conversations/workshops,
including on:

- git/Github
- visualizing data

I created a short sign-up form (with a question for your email address and the extent of your prior experience using RMarkdown and R); if you sign-up, I'll send you a Zoom link to the workshop, but will 
not use your email address for any other purpose: https://forms.gle/kbopkbNdXfeJBEqm7
