Like many things posted to the #rstats hashtag on Twitter, [a recent post 
requesting resources related to using R Markdown](https://twitter.com/jrosenberg6432/status/1258739495547080710) led to a number of helpful 
ones. The post was in the context of learning R and R Markdown for research-
related projects in education.

I shared many resources (and the post) with a graduate research assistant and thought about meeting one-on-one to review the resources - but, there are a few other students at my insitution who might also be interested, and so I thought to share the plan with and invite others to join in.

- This *Friday, May 15, from noon - 1:00 pm EST*, we'll meet to discuss using R Markdown
- The conversation will be situated in the context of *educational research and education*
- Beginners welcome; R Markdown is possibly a great way to start to use R (though you can do *a lot* with it as the foundation)
- Schedule:
    - First 20 minutes, an introduction to R and R Markdown
    - Second 20 minutes, you working through an R Markdown document (more on how in the next point)
    - Last 20 minutes discussion/questions and answers
- We'll use RStudio Cloud, so folks can get started with zero prerequisites
- Throughout, I'll draw on and refer to the resources shared about R Markdown
- I'll plan to record and host the video (probably on Vimeo) for others to view in the future

This is thus especially for those in education - students, researchers, as well as data analysts/scientists and teachers - though anyone is welcome to join. 

There's **a short sign-up form** with only a question for your email address and the extent of your prior experience using RMarkdown and why you're interested in joining (mostly to weed out spammers), I'll send a Zoom link before the workshop/conversation and won't use your email address for any other purpose: https://forms.gle/kbopkbNdXfeJBEqm7
