The [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) announced last week (via email and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JOSS_TheOJ/status/1238430728343433222)) that:

> Submissions to JOSS are suspended for 30 days to provide relief to authors, editors, and reviewers dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The attached image from the Tweet is an elaboration of this announcement:

I think this is a good idea, and support it. Setting the expectation from the "top-down" can support individuals' decision (necessary or forced) to slow their pace of non-urgent work, and I'd be happy if other journals - especially those I submit to or review for - decided to the same.
