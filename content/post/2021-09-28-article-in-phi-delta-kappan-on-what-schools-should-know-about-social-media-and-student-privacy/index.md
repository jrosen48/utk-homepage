With Macy Burchfield (undergraduate at UTK), Conrad Borchers and Christian Fischer (undergraduate and faculty at the University of Tubingen), Benjamin Gibbons (underraduate at Emory), and Daniel Anderson (faculty at the University of Oregon), I wrote a short article building on [our International Conference on Educational Data Mining presentation](https://educationaldatamining.org/EDM2021/virtual/poster_paper276.html) (that won the Best Poster Award for the conference). The article is intended primarily for administrators/educational leaders. It is secondarily for researchers and analysts.
