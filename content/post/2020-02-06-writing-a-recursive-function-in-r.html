<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Recursion has been a topic I’ve <em>heard</em> about, and even <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions.html#ast-funs"><em>read</em> about it</a>, but have never used. Recently, I was analyzing data for the Next Generation Science Standards hashtag on Twitter, and was puzzled to find that some of the Tweets I had accessed were replies to Tweets which were themselves not in the data set.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the rtweet package returns data on which Tweet a reply is to; using these, it is possible (using rtweet) to access the original Tweet.</p>
<p>But, this raises an issue: What if the Tweet a reply is to is itself a reply (to another Tweet)? This problem starts to become a little complex. The solution I had tried was to use a <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html">while loop</a>; this worked basically fine, but I sensed there might be a better way. I talked this through with a student, and decided to see whether I could get it to work this way.</p>
<p>This post represents my attempt to write <em>a recursive function</em> - one that involves calling itself.</p>
</div>
<div id="twitter-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Twitter Data</h2>
<p>First, let’s access the data. I use rtweet to access 5,000 recent Tweets with the #rstats hashtag.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rtweet)

d &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#rstats&quot;, n = 5000)</code></pre>
<p>From these Tweets, there appear to be 5000 Tweets that are replies.</p>
</div>
<div id="writing-a-recursive-function" class="section level2">
<h2>Writing a recursive function</h2>
<p>Here is my attempt at writing a recursive function; it takes one argument, <code>statuses</code>, which is the status ids for the Tweets a reply is to; the <code>reply_to_status_id</code> column in the data collected from rtweet.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_replies_recursive &lt;- function(statuses) {
  statuses &lt;- statuses[!is.na(statuses)] # this line removes the NAs, which are very common because most Tweets are not replies
  new_data &lt;- lookup_statuses(statuses)
  
  print(paste0(&quot;Accessed &quot;, nrow(new_data), &quot; new Tweets&quot;))
  
  new_statuses &lt;- new_data$reply_to_status_id[!is.na(new_data$reply_to_status_id)]

  if (length(new_statuses) &gt; 0) {
    new_data_recursive &lt;- get_replies_recursive(new_statuses) # this is the key line where the function calls itself, but passing new statuses
    out_data &lt;- rbind(new_data, new_data_recursive)
  } else {
    print(paste0(&quot;Accessed &quot;, nrow(new_data), &quot; new Tweets in total&quot;))
    return(new_data)
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="using-the-function" class="section level2">
<h2>Using the function</h2>
<p>Using it is simple; you just pass the variable for the status ids for the Tweets a reply is to.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_replies &lt;- get_replies_recursive(d$reply_to_status_id)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Accessed 74 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 23 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 16 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 10 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 9 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 4 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 2 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 2 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 2 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 2 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 2 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 2 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 2 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 1 new Tweets&quot;
## [1] &quot;Accessed 1 new Tweets in total&quot;</code></pre>

<p>I’m unsure exactly how much more better (clear, efficient) using recursion is here, compared to the former approach I tried; I think this code is a bit simpler. I am also unsure how generally useful recursion is in real-life programming. Lastly, I’m not sure I did this quite right: I went down a bit of a recursive rabbit hole. But, this seemed to work, and I welcome any feedback about it.</p>
