When my graduate school friend [Spencer Greenhalgh](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/) and I started our current positions more than two years ago, we began a podcast. Then, we became busy and stopped, and stopped paying for hosting. Just so these didn't disappear forever, we archived them in a public Google Drive folder:

I've often listened to these multiple times - it has been a fun way for me to remember back (not too long ago---but still!) to my first year at UTK. I'm glad Spencer and I are still collaborating other ways, but do miss our recording of the pod.
