A repeated theme of my blog is that I use it to share what I think, whether its political, personal, or . . . something else entirely. This post - like many! - is personal. 

For whatever reason, I've been reflecting this fall on a specific winter from when we lived in Lansing, Michigan, when it was super, duper cold. There was a polar vortex, and temperatures were regularly (I remember in early January) -20F or colder. -20F! It was unbelievably cold. I remember staying inside and also biking to work (when it wasn't _that_ cold; closer to 0F). I wrapped my face in the warmest balaclava I could find and wore two pairs of gloves. I don't really know how to capture that winter or my wife and my experience, except that it somehow bonded us to one another. I've lost track of years, but either that year or the year after, we stayed in Lansing for the winter break, not traveling to visit my wife's parents in North Carolina or even to my parents near Detroit. During these times, I felt like we arrived in Michigan, even though they were years after we moved.

We moved to Knoxville in Summer, 2018, more than two years ago. To put it simply, the last two years have been bananas. I won't say any more on that! They have been good, hard years. This fall, my wife and son and I started to fall into a routine. My wife had three night classes; I had one. By the time the weekend arrived, we were zonked! But, Saturday or Sunday, we would go somewhere outdoors. These trips started to line up, weekend after weekend (this was the 12th week of the fall semester). With them, we started to return to places we had been before; the Smokies, Frozen Head, Obed, Ijams. 

I don't feel like we have fully arrived in Knoxville. Thinking of Michigan, my wife and I knew every street (that we had biked on!), high school, and place we went near where we lived on Lansing's east side and around town. I had friends from soccer refereeing outside of the University; and best friends from or connected to MSU. I think of our son being born on a snowy day in Lansing; Knoxville won't come close to it in my mind.

But, I think we may have arrived in Knoxville, finally. I don't know what living in Knoxville will bring; that's an open question. But like living through a Michigan, I feel like we've lived through a strange, challenging fall, and have made it somewhere new.
