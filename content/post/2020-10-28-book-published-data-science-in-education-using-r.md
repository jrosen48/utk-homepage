You've likely heard me post, talk, or share about the book that is now published, 
*Data Science in Education Using R*. I just wanted to compile a few things here:

- The book is _always_ available open-access here: 
- The book is available for purchase in soft or hardcover versions through Routledge ([here](https://www.routledge.com/Data-Science-in-Education-Using-R/Estrellado-Freer-Mostipak-Rosenberg-Velasquez/p/book/9780367422257)) (use code BSE20 for 20% off); you can always find it on Amazon ([here](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Education-Using-R/dp/0367422255/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=data+science+in+education+using+r&qid=1593880609&sr=8-2)) or-we hope-your local and independent bookstore
- Third, a recording of our book launch from this past Monday is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUnKFspyits) 

A blurb on the book is here:

> Data Science in Education Using R is the go-to reference for learning data science in the education field. The book answers questions like: What does a data scientist in education do? How do I get started learning R, the popular open-source statistical programming language? And what does a data analysis project in education look like?

> If you’re just getting started with R in an education job, this is the book you’ll want with you. This book gets you started with R by teaching the building blocks of programming that you’ll use many times in your career. The book takes a "learn by doing" approach and offers eight analysis walkthroughs that show you a data analysis from start to finish, complete with code for you to practice with. The book finishes with how to get involved in the data science community and how to integrate data science in your education job.

> This book will be an essential resource for education professionals and researchers looking to increase their data analysis skills as part of their professional and academic development.

Some endorsements for it are here (thank you to the five individuals who wrote these for the book!):

> "The authors have provided the definitive guide to the topic. The combination of theory and hands-on practical tutorials make this an invaluable resource for the growing fields of learning analytics and educational data science." - Mark Warschauer, Professor of Education and Informatics at the University of California, Irvine

> "This book is a clear, compelling guide for real-world practitioners who are ready to use modern tools of data science in the education domain. The effective data analysis content would benefit almost anyone getting started with data today, but these authors' thoughtful, focused handling of the specific issues involved in working with education data sets it apart from most introductory data science books." - Julia Silge, Software Engineer at RStudio

> "There are many resources for learning how to analyze education data. But what has long been missing is an inclusive and pedagogically refined resource on how to leverage modern data science principles, workflows, and tools. Data Science in Education using R fills this massive gap and more. It will be the go to resource for the next generation of data driven education professionals. And is a beautiful exposition of how to responsibly work with data from the real, messy, world." - Dustin Tingley, Deputy Vice Provost for Advances in Learning at Harvard University

> "Data Science in Education Using R provides a wide menu of resources for individuals in education who wish to both learn R and think more deeply about their relationship to data. The book provides both practical guidance through worked examples and discussions of relevant theory and past research. That the book is written by authors who have varied research and practice positions lends itself to its broad-ranging appeal." - Teomara (Teya) Rutherford, Assistant Professor of Learning Sciences, University of Delaware

> "Doing data science in education is an interdisciplinary endeavor. If you are a teacher, an administrator, or an educational researcher who's looking for a theory-informed, practice-oriented, and equity-minded introduction to educational data science, no need to look further than this book. It will help you unleash your data science 'superpower,' turbocharge your practice, and make real-world changes in your organization." - Bodong Chen, Associate Professor and Co-Director of Learning Informatics Lab at the University of Minnesota

So, what's next?!? I'm both excited and just a tad bit sad this project is coming to at least a milestone. Some things that we're working on are continuing to update the website-based version of the book (based on issues that came up during the copy-editing and proofing), and in response to reader's feedback and input. We're also interested in supporting translations of the book (and have been contacted by a few readers interested in supporting this, too). Finally, we're looking to continue to work on projects (probably a bit smaller in scope, for now) together, and pursuing our own interests on the topic. Thanks to everyone for the support along the way.
