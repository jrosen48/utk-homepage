Building from [a crowdsourced list of educational data science-related courses](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2020/05/14/post-secondary-courses-related-to-data-science-in-education-a-crowdsourced-list-of-sorts/), I wrote a proposal for a course I hope to teach at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, *Data Science in Education Using R*. 

A description/roposal for the course is here: https://joshuamrosenberg.com/proposal-ds-in-edu-utk.pdf

I welcome feedback, especially at this stage where it could impact the likelihood that the course is offered---or, if offered, useful to students.
If you do have any feedback or suggestions, please message me at jmrosenberg AT utk dot edu... or otherwise reach out!
