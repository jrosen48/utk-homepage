## Blogging is (arguably, still) cool

[More than six months ago](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/04/18/resetting-how-i-use-social-media/), I stepped away from using social media, and it has been fine, but the primary way I communicate is via blogging---arguably an out-of-date medium, but, at the same time, maybe a valuable one:

- You own the content --- not a social media platform with a possibly impetus owner
- You can write longer pieces
- You are not as tied to what people like/dislike as indicated by social media interactions

My friend Enilda Romero-Hall recently mentioned the importance of blogging in a seminar presentation. This mention has made me re-commit to blogging. It is the best way for me to critique, share, update, reflect, etc. It doesn't have to be and often isn't perfect, but I think it has some strong advantages relative to social media.

## How to subscribe or follow

So. Please consider subscribing or following. 

**The easiest way is to enter your email** to receive an email when I post on my blog. You can do that here: https://joshuamrosenberg.substack.com/. 

**The second easiest way is to "follow" the blog feed** via a tool such as [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) (you might remember a similar, now defunct feed reader, Google Reader, RIP). You can search for the blog via its URL (https://joshuamrosenberg.com) or add the URL to the feed directly: https://joshuamrosenberg.com/index.xml 

Please do this (if and only if you would like)! Thank you.
