With Ting Dai and Michael Lawson, I wrote a chapter on data visualization. It is fr the Routledge Encyclopedia of Education. We actually wrote this _a long_ time ago - way back in 2019! 

In the chapter, we reviewed research on data visualizations, shared example visualizations, and provided R code to reproduce all of the graphs.

The Encyclopedia was on hold for awhile, and so we had to wait something we were proud to share. Thankfully, the chapter is available now.

It is available as a PDF [here](/dai-et-al-2022-data-representations.pdf).
