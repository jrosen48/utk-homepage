With Ting Dai and Michael Lawson, I wrote a chapter on data visualization. It is fr the Routledge Encyclopedia of Education. We actually wrote this _a long_ time ago - way back in 2019! 

In the chapter, we reviewed research on data visualizations, shared example visualizatins, and provided R code to reproduce all of the graphs.

The Encyclopedia was on o hold for awhile, and so we had to wait something we were proud to share. Thankfully, the chapter is available now.
