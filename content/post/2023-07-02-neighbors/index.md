There is nothing like family, nor is there anything like close friends, but there is also nothing like neighbors, who can be a little bit like both family and friends. 

We had a somewhat impromptu shower for the baby (due date in eight weeks, +- a standard deviation of around one week) last night in our cul-de-sac last night. It was the kind of event that made me feel sincerely happy and thankful for neighbors.

It was also like many other nights; these images - lawn chairs right on the pavement, kids running wild - is thankfully common, but something for which I am sincerely thankful.
