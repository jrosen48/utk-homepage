As this post's title indicates, this isn't a typical blog post for me; it's on 
(much) a personal note. I'll preface this post by saying that I'm fundamentally
healthy (and so is my fam): that is sort of the thesis of the post.

Starting in December, our son came down with a bad ear infection that continued 
through the holiday break (and the new year). He got better - we got sick - and 
we moved on. Then he got another ear infection, then another (and another!?! I'm 
not sure), and, then, came down with an ear infection (and - we think - the flu, 
which we came down with, too) this past weekend. We finally bit the bullet,
and scheduled an appointment for a [tubes surgery]
(https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ear-tubes/about/pac-20384667). It 
was a hard decision, because it is a surgery, but, it's somewhat non-invasive, 
and, from what we can tell, it should help.

So, the first part of this post was about sickness; the second part is about 
gratitude. All of us in our family fundamenetally have our health; we'll bounce 
back; and. As challenging as the last few months have been, they are also a 
humbling reminder to be grateful for what is most important. And, so, this post
is just a reflection on that - a lot of sickness, a little gratitude.
