We moved around two weeks ago, which is really thrilling. Also, Katie began a school librarian position at [L&N STEM Academy](https://www.knoxschools.org/landn), a fantastic and unique public magnet school in Knox County Schools last week, which is also really thrilling. And, so . . . this summer has been so good! And it has been stressful.

Last weekend, I took our little camping while Katie worked at home to set up the house. It was at my favorite non-Smokies getaway (as the Smokies are in a category of their own), [Frozen Head State Park](https://tnstateparks.com/parks/frozen-head). It's fantastic, but don't tell anyone, because it is a bit of a hidden gem as a kid-friendly campground (though the [Barkley Marathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkley_Marathons) happen to be there.

In March and April, I camped or backpacked a bunch, including a [wild, cold backpacking trip in the Smokies with our little one](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2021/04/18/a-difference-between-backpacking-with-and-without-little-ones/). Then the summer began, and the busy-ness and some stress has not abated much, but I am camping with our little one again this weekend and next week, and so am planting a bit of a flag - the summer stress is done. What fall will bring is another question.
