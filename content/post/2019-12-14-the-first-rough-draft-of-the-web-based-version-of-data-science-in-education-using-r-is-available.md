The first, rough draft of the (web-based version) of the *Data Science in Education Using R* book written by Emily Bovee](https://www.emilybovee.com/), [Ryan Estrellado](https://ryanestrellado.netlify.com/), [Jesse Motstipak](https://www.jessemaegan.com/), me, and [Isabella Velásquez](https://ivelasq.rbind.io) is available from this URL: http://www.datascienceineducation.com/.

I mentioned in [an earlier post](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/posts/introducing-data-science-in-education-using-r-forthcoming-2020/) that the published, Routledge, allowed us to stipulate that we retain the copyright for the web-based version, even after the book is published in print (and e-book) format.

This is definitely a first, rough (rough!) draft (this will be particularly in the context of some of the network plots, [which rendered in a ridiculous way](https://www.datascienceineducation.com/walkthrough-sna.html#plotting-the-network)). Also, we - like authors who have written books in the open from which we drew inspiration, such as [*Advanced R*]( https://adv-r.hadley.nz/introduction.html#intro-ack) - think about this as a (temporary) bug *and* a feature, as you can provide feedback on any part of the book in the GitHub repository for it ([here](https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education)) or by reaching out to any of us. We welcome and are thankful for feedback, as we have been throughout.

While we expect most of the structure of the book to change (i.e., the topics of each chapter and their order), we are actively revising, adding to, and cutting the content, and will add at least some new content prior to the final version. We expect for the book to be published sometime in the next year.
