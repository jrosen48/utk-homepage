This is a strange post for me following a strange series of days. On Thursday of last week, 
I noticed I felt a bit off, noticing that I had coughed a few times during the day, had a bit of a headache and a 
runny nose and just the slightest congested in my chest, but without the need to cough. I also couldn't/didn't sneeeze, which is weird for me (don't laugh!).  The way the symptoms came on was such that I didn't consider it was COVID until I noticed what all of the symptoms _together_ might
suggest. 

Fortunately (?!?), when our little one's daycare was closed due to COVID, we had acquired several rapid COVID
tests from Wal-Mart, so I took one late Thursday night. The result was... positive. I both wasn't surprised
because of my symptoms and was also shocked. I hadn't had any one event that I thought would have exposed me,
though COVID is so prevalent within our community that there were at least two or three plausible ways I could
have been exposed. So, I immediately quarantined from my family. Very unfortunately, our in-laws had _just_
arrived that night. My wife took a test and the result was negative. Fortunately, I didn't expose them for more than a few hours.

So, I went to bed figuring that we'd have - assuming no one else tested positive - something like 10 days apart, 
with our little one home from daycare (and my wife missing work) for the duration. Not a super thrilling prospect. 
I messaged students who I had in class that week. I messaged colleagues letting them know things were going to be rocky for me.

The next morning, I woke up feeling about the same. I took another rapid test around noon. The result was . . . negative. 
This was _more_ surprising than the positive test I'd taken the night before. I had made an appointment for a lab-based/PCR test, 
which I assumed would be positive - that the second rapid test was a false negative; that I'd swabbed my nose incorrectly or that the
test simply had an error rate in how precisely it could detect the virus. I made my way to the PCR test and had a bit of an 
odd rest of the day, thinking about the stress this would cause my wife and how bad I felt about her parents arriving (and then . . . leaving). 

Given how short it was, I was surprised to see an email with my PCR test results the next morning. The result was . . . negative. My response was something to the effect of: What the world?!! I still had symptoms, but my understanding is that the PCR test - which I'd taken _later_ than the others - was far and away the most accurate (or _sensitive_) in terms of detecting positive COVID cases. So I was negative? I rejoined my family sans my wife's parents that morning. 

The whole series of events was genuinely confusing. In the day or two after receiving the negative PCR test, I figured that the first rapid test must have been a false positive, that somehow I had some inert COVID virus in my nose (yuck) or that the chemicals used for the test can somehow react in a way that indicates a positive result in the absence of any COVID virus. But, a few more days out, feeling better and having poured over [the clinical trial data for the rapid test](https://www.ellumehealth.com/uploads/COVID19-Home-Test-Product-Overview-for-Healthcare-Professionals-D.pdf), my best guess is that I had a very mild case of COVID - that my symptoms were like that of a mild mild cold - and that I was contagious and able to transmit COVID on Thursday, but not on Friday when I took the other tests. Given that the PCR test was negative, coupled with feeling better, I think I can be fairly confident that I'm not able to transmit the virus to others, but my plan is to lay out for at least several more days and to asseess how I'm feeling (and how the rest of my family is feeling). 

So, I possibly, maybe contracted COVID (while vaccinated). Articles like [this one](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/coronavirus-testing-delta-vaccines/619927/) suggest (very plausibly) that one being vaccinated means that tests for COVID operate differently than for one who is not vaccinated. I'm thankful that I've been vaccinated and that really, truly, the experience I had was no worse than a mild cold - hard to distinguish from that, even. But, the logistics around (possibly, maybe) contracting COVID are so much more immense than a cold, and the high stakes of that (no daycare for the little one and therefore no work for my wife) made this disorienting. And this post is my attempt to process all of that!
