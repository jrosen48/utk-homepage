I wrote a paper with three great colleagues and a doctoral student here, and I'm thrilled to share it soon. It's entitled *Big Data, Big Changes? The Technologies and Sources of Data Used in Science Classrooms* and it will be published in a special issue of the *British Journal of Educational Technology* on *Data Science Across the Disciplines*. The publishing process was good; reviews were constructively critical, making the work better, and the editors handling the paper were helpful and constructively critical, too (note: this special issue is co-edited by my colleagues Victor Lee and Shiyan Jiang; I was not involved with editing the article I co-authored to safeguard the review process). 
When going through the final steps to publish the article, I was interested in making the work more accessible through an open-access (OA) license. When considering the cost, though, it was just too (damn!) high: $3,750. 

My colleagues and I wrote the paper (without any compensation); the reviewers reviewed it (without any compensation); the editors handled the paper (without any compensation). Wiley provided a platform, some minimal typesetting services, and the service of hosting the paper. In 2022, there is no reason why $3,750 is in the ballpark of reasonable; at most, to retain healthy profit margins, around $1,000 is not an unreasonable fee. The OA fees are too damn high. (A pre-print of the paper is [here](https://edarxiv.org/tv4zg/).)

I need to do more to advocate for better publishing approaches. I place some responsibility on my senior colleagues who have not advocated enough for better publishing models, but enough complaining - you can hold me responsible for doing better by others, the public, and my future more junior colleagues. Enough!

*Aside: A publication with colleagues on the imperative to expand open science in science education is [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tea.21730). The piece is not open-access because the OA fee was around the same amount---far too high. A pre-print is [here](https://osf.io/sqcn7).
