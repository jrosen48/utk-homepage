Here are a two more sets of haikus and poems I wrote today, with much
assistance from chatGPT ([here's a bit of background on
this)](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2023/01/25/three-haiku-with-help-from-ai/).

## 1. A quiet winter break

1\. In response to this prompt:

> Please write a Haiku based on the following blog post: Around 2015, my
> wife and I didn't leave Lansing, Michigan, during the winter break. It
> was cold, snowy, dark, and one of the best and most special breaks I
> remember. It was a time of quiet reflection, much like this winter
> break when my family didn't leave (Knoxville, Tennessee). I am still
> basking in the quiet (and the cold --- and the pretty dark evenings!).
> I found this song by one of my favorite groups, Mandoling Orange, on
> YouTube and it captured my current mood. It is perfection!

It generated the following (I prompted it twice for follow-ups):

> Quiet winter break
>
> Memories of Lansing snow
>
> Peaceful, dark, and cold.

---

> Winter stillness reigns
>
> In Lansing and Knoxville too,
>
> A time for reflection.

---

> Snowy Michigan,
>
> Quiet break with my loved one,
>
> Memories aglow.

I also switched "Haiku" out for "sonnet," and it generated the
following:

> In Lansing, Michigan, where the snow falls deep, We stayed put, my
> love and I, and did not leap. The quiet and the cold, the dark and the
> still, A time of reflection, our hearts to fill.
>
> The memories of that winter, so crisp and so clear, Remind me of this
> one, now, so near. In Knoxville, Tennessee, where the world slows
> down, I find peace in the quiet and the pretty dark town.
>
> And as I listen to the music, soft and sweet, By Mandolin Orange, my
> heart skips a beat. Their words and melodies, they capture my mood, In
> this winter wonderland, I feel understood.
>
> So let the snow fall, let the darkness come, For in this quiet
> reflection, my heart will become. A peaceful, grateful, and contented
> place, In this winter break, memories to embrace.

## 2. A bear chase

I prompted it to write a Haiku based on the contents of [this
post](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/post/2022/06/20/bear-chase/)(that I
copy-pasted) about a bear following us around Andrews Bald.

> Bear on trail ahead
>
> Heartbeats rise, fear spreads wide
>
> Singing songs, retreat

I thought this was pretty good, but I asked for another with a whimsical
element; it generated the following:

> Bear on the path, oh no!
>
> We sing and shout, hike away fast
>
> A workout, unplanned.

Better than the last ones!
