I'm grateful for the opportunity to begin serving as an Associate Editor for the [*Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education*](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ujse21). It's a great fit for what I'm interested in and I'm excited to serve in an editorial capacity. It's also entirely open-access! If you're doing data science education-related research---in K-12 education, generally, and in science education, especially---I'd love to very humbly invite you to submit your work to the journal.
