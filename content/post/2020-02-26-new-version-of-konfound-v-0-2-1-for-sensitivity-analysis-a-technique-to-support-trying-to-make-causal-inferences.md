A new version of konfound (v 0.2.1) for sensitivity analysis (a technique to support making causal inferences, especially in light of observational data) is available. 

This version includes a new technique for non-linear models (i.e., a logistic regression). 

Documentation for the package is available here: https://jrosen48.github.io/konfound/

We also updated the Shiny app associated with the package, available here: http://konfound-it.com/
