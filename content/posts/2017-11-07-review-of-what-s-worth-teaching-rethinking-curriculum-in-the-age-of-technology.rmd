I was recently requested to submit a review with Charles Logan for the book *What’s Worth Teaching: Rethinking Curriculum in the Age of Technology* by the incredible scholar Allan Collins. A link to the review and book on the Teachers College Record website [here](http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentID=22173). A pre-print of our review is also available [here](https://github.com/jrosen48/homepage-source/raw/master/static/_media/publications/Rosenberg-Logan-TCR-Review-2017.pdf).
