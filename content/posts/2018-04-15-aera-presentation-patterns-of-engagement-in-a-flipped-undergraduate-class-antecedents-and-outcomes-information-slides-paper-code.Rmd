I'm presenting a second paper at AERA on patterns of (outside of class) engagement in a flipped undergraduate class with my colleagues You-kyung Lee, Kristy Robinson, John Ranellucci, Cary Roseth, and Lisa Linnenbrink-Garcia. The presentation is at 8:15 am (Sunday, 4/15) in the Millenium Broadway Hotel (Room 7.04) and is on a session on emotions, engagement, and technology (with some very interesting papers presented by co-presenters in the session!).
