<h2>My goal: To write a CV in one format and in a way so that it can be rendered in multiple formats</h2>
<p>I have been trying to write my CV once and have it be displayed/rendered as HTML (for this website), a PDF (for sharing), and a Word document (also for sharing - as some folks require it to be in this format).</p>
<p>I have something that seems to work and so thought I would share what I did as a first attempt. In part, I hoped doing so would spark other folks sharing better ways (or suggesting improvements to me).</p>
<p>Just as a sidenote, using <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> to create my website was essential.</p>

<div id="the-results" class="section level1">
<h1>The results</h1>
<p>Here’s what I did; all of the source files are available <a href="https://github.com/jrosen48/utk-homepage">here</a>; the final versions are available in the following formats from different URLs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HTML: <a href="https://www.joshuamrosenberg.com/about/">https://www.joshuamrosenberg.com/about</a></p></li>
<li><p>PDF: <a href="https://www.joshuamrosenberg.com/rosenberg-cv.pdf" class="uri">https://www.joshuamrosenberg.com/rosenberg-cv.pdf</a></p></li>
<li><p>Word (.docx): <a href="https://www.joshuamrosenberg.com/cv/rosenberg-cv.docx" class="uri">https://www.joshuamrosenberg.com/cv/rosenberg-cv.docx</a></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="my-process" class="section level1">
<h1>My process</h1>
<p><em>All of the file locations refer to the source <a href="https://github.com/jrosen48/utk-homepage">here</a></em>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Treated the file at <code>content/about-source.md</code> as the one file in which I wrote (and will update) my CV</li>
<li>Added a file (in a new directory), <code>r/build.R</code>, which contains <code>cv-utils.R</code></li>
<li>This script (<code>cv-utils.R</code>) does most of the work:
<ul>
<li>copies <code>content/about-source.md</code> to <code>static/cv</code> with the name (and file type) changed to <code>rosenberg-cv.Rmd</code> (and which)</li>
<li>reads <code>content/about-source.md</code>
<ul>
<li>then removes the LaTeX tags</li>
<li>writes the file to to <code>static/cv</code> with the name (and file type) changed to <code>rosenberg-cv.Rmd</code></li>
<li>and renders the Word document using <code>Rosenberg-CV-template.docx</code> as the document template (created by using the “Incremental style editing” described <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html">here</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>does essentially the steps taken to render the Word document <em>again</em> to render the HTML version
<ul>
<li>but with a line added after the front matter with a link to the PDF version</li>
<li>and with the result being saved to <code>content/about.md</code> to serve as basis for the HTML file rendered with that file name (i.e., the file <a href="https://www.joshuamrosenberg.com/about/">here</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s basically it. It’s a bit clunky; but, it seems to mostly work.</p>
<div id="to-do" class="section level2">
<h2>To do</h2>
<p>For the CV to be (more) useful in Word document and HTML format, there is a change/improvement that need to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to center the contact information at the beginning of the file</li>
</ul>
<p>And probably others that you see. Let me know through an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/jrosen48/utk-homepage">GitHub repository</a>, by email (jmrosenberg [at] utk [dot] edu), or via <a href="http://twitter.com/jrosenberg6432">Twitter</a>.</p>
