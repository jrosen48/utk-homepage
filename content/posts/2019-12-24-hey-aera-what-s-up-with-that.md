I like the [American Educational Research Association](https://aera.net); it's my professional home.

I was pretty surprised to see [this letter](https://presspage-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/1508/coalitionletteropposinglowerembargoes-864869.pdf?54750), advocating *against* open access to educational research that is funded through federal agencies (i.e., the [Institute of Educational Sciences](https://ies.ed.gov), the [National Science Foundation](https://nsf.gov), etc.).

Inside Higher Ed has [an article on AERA's (and other professional organization's) opposition](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/12/20/concern-raised-over-white-house-open-access-policy).

Basically, this is wrong. I think AERA is on the wrong side of a trend - driven by access to information through the Internet - toward open access. Additionally, I'm pretty bummed that AERA took this stand. I don't think that they consulted with their members about this, as I would have opposed it - and I'm sure many others would have, too.

I'm not leaving AERA over this, but I'm certainly not dropping this and moving on, either. 

h/t [Daniel Anderson](https://datalorax.github.io/anderson-cv/) for making me aware of this.
