Last summer, I taught the [MAET Year 2 Summer Cohort](http://edutech.educ.msu.edu/programs/masters/summer-hybrid/0) with [Danah Henriksen](http://danah-henriksen.com/). After teaching the class, Danah realized she had taught five cohorts of (awesome) students and that we had some information available from pre- and post-course self-reported surveys to understand how students grew in terms of their confidence in using different educational (and other) technologies. 

That research idea evolved into a study with [Rohit Mehta](http://mehtarohit.com/) that involved, among other findings, a visualization of average pre-post values for specific technologies. Over back-and-forth emails, Rohit and I shaped the figure up into *what we think* is a good representation, using the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) R package.  

We realized our back-and-forth in terms of our revisions was possibly interesting to the extent that it showed us that there isn't often one right way to create a figure using, but playing around and revising one can help.

Also, we thought the findings were interesting! Alignment represents how much of a focus the particular technology was over the course of the three summer classes; students seemed to grow, even in technologies that *were not the focus of or aligned with the activities in the classes*.

We were generating these interactively and did not think to save or commit earlier versions; but the code for the final version (version 5, below) is (in a not very edited form) [here](https://github.com/jrosen48/maet-analysis/blob/master/Survey%20Results%20Update.Rmd). 

## Version 1: Bar chart with three "facets""

## Version 2: Bar chart with different shading for different alignment

![figure2](/images/cftf/image-2.png)

## Version 3: Use of points instead of bars with different alignment

![figure3](/images/cftf/image-3.png)

## Version 4: Use of points instead of bars with different alignment

![figure4](/images/cftf/image-4.png)

## Version 5: Use of points instead of bars with different alignment and pre-survey bars dashed (instead of post-survey bars)
