<p>I’m excited to share that <code>prcr</code> (0.1.0), an R package for person-centered analysis, is now available on CRAN via <code>install.packages(&quot;prcr&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>Person-centered analyses focus on clusters, or profiles, of observations, and their change over time or differences across factors.</p>
<p>The package is designed to be “low threshold but high ceiling”, in that you can do all of the analysis with one function, <code>create_profiles(df, n_clusters)</code>, where <code>df</code>is a <code>data.frame</code> of the variables to cluster, and <code>n_clusters</code> is the specified number of clusters.</p>
<p>If you look at <code>?create_profiles()</code>, there are a lot of other options, from whether to center / scale the data (with <code>to_scale</code> and <code>to_center</code>), to the distance metric and linkage method. The function also outputs all of the information from the clustering, so you can extract the dendrogram from the hierarchical clustering, for example.</p>
<p>A brief vignette / tutorial using built-in data is <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prcr/vignettes/introduction_to_prcr.html">here</a>.</p>
