# Presentation on State Educational Twitter Hashtags at #siteconf

With [Matthew Koehler](http://www.matt-koehler.com/), [Mete Akcaoglu](http://www.meteakcaoglu.com/), [Spencer Greenhalgh](http://www.spencergreenhalgh.com/), and [Erica Hamilton](https://www.gvsu.edu/coe/faculty_single.htm?facultyID=21190609-9046-E6D6-055E1D6EA2925382), I presented on State Educational Twitter Hashtags at the [Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education conference](http://site.aace.org/conf/). We created an interactive web application to share the findings using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) that is [available here](https://jmichaelrosenberg.shinyapps.io/SETHs/). If you check it out then please let us know what you think.
