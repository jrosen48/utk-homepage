I have used [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) for more than seven years. Over that time, I've used multiple shared servers, and have had a myriad of domain names. 

Most recently, my shared server at Lansing, MI-based [Liquid Web](https://www.liquidweb.com/) ended, due to Liquid Web leaving the shared hosting business to focus only on dedicated and virtual private servers. 

I started to look for a new hosting company, and slowly started to coalesce around the idea of, well, not having one, and using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) instead.

I already have a number of files on GitHub ([here](https://github.com/jrosen48)) and especially like the simplicity of it - and the ability to write in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), not HTML.

So that is what I am doing.
