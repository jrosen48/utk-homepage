I was lucky to have the chance to present at the [Middle Tennessee State University](https://www.mtsu.edu/) [Math and Science Education Seminar Series](https://www.mtsu.edu/math/seminar-series.php).

# Presentation

My presentation was on *Making data science count: Exploring the integration of data science into education*.

A link to the presentation is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cwjLwHRsrHq6dX9oiyHutNdb9wzfoAqcyM7DKXD38yU/edit?usp=sharing).

# Workshop

I also carried out a two-hour workshop on *An introduction to data science in education using R*. A repository for the workshop, including a link to slides, code, and data, is here: https://github.com/jrosen48/mtsu-workshop
