# Presentation on an Introduction to R for Programming and Statistical Analysis in Education

I had the opportunity to present an Introduction to R for Programming and Statistical Analysis in Education on the invitation of my colleague [Mete Akcaoglu](http://www.meteakcaoglu.com/) at [Georgia Southern University's College of Education](http://coe.georgiasouthern.edu/). The presentation is [available here](http://rpubs.com/jmichaelrosenberg/164105).
