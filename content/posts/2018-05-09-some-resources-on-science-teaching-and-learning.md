I'll be starting a position in STEM Education at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](http://utk.edu/), beginning this August. As part of this position, I'll teach science teaching methods (and science and STEM education research-related) courses. Hearing about the first course I'll teach sparked me to gather these.

So, this is a loosely-organized collection of some resources--especially some new(er) books and National Academies Press (NAP) reports--related to science teaching and learning. I leave "oldies but goodies", like [Taking Science to School (2007)](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11625/taking-science-to-school-learning-and-teaching-science-in-grades), the [Framework for K-12 Science Education (2012)](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13165/a-framework-for-k-12-science-education-practices-crosscutting-concepts), and [America's Lab Report (2006)](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11311/americas-lab-report-investigations-in-high-school-science) for example. 

As a few notes, while I didn't add annotation on *why* they're included, I think these are all worth (at least my) attention. Also, these are just what I've found and am trying to read *right now*. I am sure there are a number of other great, new resources that I missed--and look forward to finding out about!
