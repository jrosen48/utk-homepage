<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Research in classrooms and schools can be complex because of all of the factors that matter. A question that often comes up when we say that we observed some pattern in data is, <em>but did you control for X</em>?</p>
<p>In the context of working on an approach to find out how impactful an omitted variable would need to be to invalidate an inference, we had to modify a function that worked for a single sensitivity analysis to work for many and to be easier to use.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-initial-version-of-the-function" class="section level4">
<h4>The initial version of the function</h4>
<p>In the context of programming (and mathematics!), many functions take inputs and then transform them into output.</p>
<p>Imagine we have a function that takes two values used to calculate a <em>t</em>-test, the <em>t</em> statistic (the coefficient divided by its standard error) and the degrees of freedom of the <em>t</em> distribution. it then returns a bunch of output about how sensitive an inference based on the <em>t</em>-test is to bias or to an omitted confounding variable.</p>
<p>Here is a function that outputs values about the sensitivity of a <em>t</em>-test as a row in a row of a data frame (actually an R <code>data.frame</code> modified to be a bit easier to work with, an <code>R</code> tibble).</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a whopper:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>core_sensitivity_mkonfound &lt;- function(t, df, alpha = .05, tails = 2) {
    
    critical_t &lt;- stats::qt(1 - (alpha / tails), df)
    critical_r &lt;- critical_t / sqrt((critical_t ^ 2) + df)
    
    obs_r &lt;- abs(t / sqrt(df + (t ^ 2)))
    
    # for replacement of cases framework
    if (abs(obs_r) &gt; abs(critical_r)) {
        action &lt;- &quot;to_invalidate&quot;
        inference &lt;- &quot;reject_null&quot;
        pct_bias &lt;- 100 * (1 - (critical_r / obs_r)) }
    else if (abs(obs_r) &lt; abs(critical_r)) {
        action &lt;- &quot;to_sustain&quot;
        inference &lt;- &quot;fail_to_reject_null&quot;
        pct_bias &lt;- 100 * (1 - (obs_r / critical_r)) }
    else if (obs_r == critical_r) {
        action &lt;- NA
        inference &lt;- NA
        pct_bias &lt;- NA
    }
    
    if ((abs(obs_r) &gt; abs(critical_r)) &amp; ((obs_r * critical_r) &gt; 0)) {
        mp &lt;- -1
    } else {
        mp &lt;- 1
    }
    
    # for correlation based framework
    itcv &lt;- (obs_r - critical_r) / (1 + mp * abs(critical_r))
    r_con &lt;- round(sqrt(abs(itcv)), 3)
    
    out &lt;- dplyr::data_frame(t, df, action, inference, pct_bias, itcv, r_con)
    names(out) &lt;- c(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;df&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;inference&quot;, &quot;pct_bias_to_change_inference&quot;, &quot;itcv&quot;, &quot;r_con&quot;)
    
    out$pct_bias_to_change_inference &lt;- round(out$pct_bias_to_change_inference, 3)
    out$itcv &lt;- round(out$itcv, 3)
    out$action &lt;- as.character(out$action)
    out$inference &lt;- as.character(out$inference)
    
    return(out)
}</code></pre>
<p>Let’s test it out. Imagine we have a <em>t</em> statistic of <code>3</code> for a hypothesis test associated with <code>100</code> degrees of freedom.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>core_sensitivity_mkonfound(3, 100)</code></pre>
<p>Works.</p>
<p>It looks like in order to invalidate the inference, around <code>32</code>% of the effect would be need to be due to bias; or, an committed variable would need to be correlated with both the predictor of interest and the dependent variable at <code>.339</code> in order to invalidate the inference.

<div id="the-second-version-of-the-function" class="section level4">
<h4>The second version of the function</h4>
<p>How could we write a function to provide output not only for one <em>t</em> and its associated <em>df</em>, but rather many values?</p>
<p>We can write a simple function to iterate through multiple values and to bind them together. The key is the <code>map()</code> function (from the <code>tidyverse</code> package <code>purrr</code>; if you are familiar with <code>R</code>, it is similar to many of the <code>apply()</code> functions). Specifically, because we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have two variables that we are iterating through</li>
<li>Want the output in <code>data.frame</code> form</li>
</ul>
<p>We use <code>map2_dfr()</code>. Check out <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html">this helpful chapter of R for Data Science</a> for more on iteration using approaches such as for and while loops as well as the useful <code>apply()</code>/ <code>map()</code> families of functions.</p>
<p>Here is what a function could look like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr)

mkonfound &lt;- function(t, df, alpha = .05, tails = 2) {
    map2_dfr(.x = t, .y = df, .f = core_sensitivity_mkonfound)
}</code></pre>
<p>Simple! But does it work? :)</p>
<p>Instead of passing a single <em>t</em> and <em>df</em>, as we did above with the <code>core_sensitivity_monfound()</code> function, we can pass vectors of <em>t</em> and <em>df</em> values:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mkonfound(t = c(3, 2, 2.5), 
          d = c(100, 200, 150))</code></pre>
<p>We could also do something like binding <em>t</em> and <em>df</em> together into a small <code>data.frame</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d &lt;- data.frame(t = c(3, 2, 2.5), 
                df = c(100, 200, 150))
d</code></pre>
<p>And then <code>mkonfound()</code> could work like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mkonfound(d$t, d$df)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-third-version-of-the-function" class="section level4">
<h4>The third version of the function</h4>
<p>Still seems to work fine. Those of you familiar with the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> may sense another possible improvement. Namely, the function could be written to both input and output a <code>data.frame</code>, and be a bit more intuitive to use via non-standard evaluation.</p>
<p>The goal is to add an additional argument for the <code>data.frame</code> (<code>d</code>), and then use non-standard evaluation to capture <em>and then later evaluate in the context of the data.frame</em> the names of the <em>t</em> and <em>df</em> columns</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rlang)
library(dplyr)

mkonfound &lt;- function(d, t, df, alpha = .05, tails = 2) {
    
    t_enquo &lt;- enquo(t)
    df_enquo &lt;- enquo(df)
    
    t = pull(select(d, !!t_enquo))
    df = pull(select(d, !!df_enquo))
    
    map2_dfr(.x = t, .y = df, .f = core_sensitivity_mkonfound)
}</code></pre>
<p>But does it work? Now, the first argument is the name of the <code>data.frame</code>, the second is the unquoted name of the column with the <em>t</em> statistics, and the third is the same as the second, but for the <em>df</em> associated with the <em>t</em>’s.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mkonfound(d, t, df)</code></pre>
<p>If we have an entire spreadsheet, read in R as a <code>data.frame</code> using the <code>read.csv()</code> (or, <code>read_csv()</code> from the very useful <code>readr</code> package) function, then we can easily compute output for all of the statistics in the spreadsheet. Here is a spreadsheet from a website (from Ken’s):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spreadsheet_of_vals &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://msu.edu/~kenfrank/example%20dataset%20for%20mkonfound.csv&quot;)
head(spreadsheet_of_vals)</code></pre>
<p>We would use it the same way as above but with <code>d</code> replaced with what we named the <code>data.frame</code> we read from the website, <code>spreadsheet_of_vals</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mkonfound(spreadsheet_of_vals, t, df)</code></pre>
<p>Since the output is in a <code>data.frame</code>, we can, for example, easily plot output:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>results_df &lt;- mkonfound(spreadsheet_of_vals, t, df)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)

results_df$action &lt;- dplyr::case_when(
    results_df$action == &quot;to_invalidate&quot; ~ &quot;To Invalidate&quot;,
    results_df$action == &quot;to_sustain&quot; ~ &quot;To Sustain&quot;
)

ggplot(results_df, aes(x = pct_bias_to_change_inference, fill = action)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    scale_fill_manual(&quot;&quot;, values = c(&quot;#1F78B4&quot;, &quot;#A6CEE3&quot;)) +
    theme_bw() +
    ggtitle(&quot;Histogram of Percent Bias&quot;) +
    facet_grid(~ action) +
    theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) +
    ylab(&quot;Count&quot;) +
    xlab(&quot;Percent Bias&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Like many functions in R, this could be written many different ways, and this post shows just one approach to writing a function.</p>
<p>In some cases, non-standard evaluation makes the function a bit harder to use - particularly in cases in which we are interested in the output from only a single study.</p>
<p>In that case, we would want to go back to the function we initially wrote (<code>core_sensitivity_mkonfound()</code>) or would have to write something a bit like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>single_study &lt;- data.frame(t = 3, df = 100)
mkonfound(single_study, t, df)</code></pre>
<p>So, this is one approach that is useful in one use - for the in-development package for sensitivity analysis with <a href="https://jrosen48.github.io/konfound/reference/index.html">a number of functions</a>, with a version of this <code>mkonfound()</code> function for meta-analyses that make use of the approach.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you are interested in sensitivity analysis, please check out the <code>konfound</code> package this is for <a href="https://jrosen48.github.io/konfound/">here</a>.</p>
