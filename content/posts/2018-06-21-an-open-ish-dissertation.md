I am defending my dissertation to my committee tomorrow. I have tried to make it as *open* as possible. One way I have done this is writing and then saving the manuscript (and code for the analysis) in a public place ([here](http://github.com/jrosen48/dissertation)).

That repository is on GitHub and includes a [PDF of my dissertation](https://github.com/jrosen48/dissertation/blob/master/docs/2018-06-14-Rosenberg-Dissertation-1.pdf) and the R Markdown files used to generate it. It also includes the [PowerPoint presentation](https://github.com/jrosen48/dissertation/blob/master/2018-06-22-Rosenberg-Dissertation-Defense-final.pptx) for tomorrow's defense.

This is in fact a "sort of" open dissertation. That is because there is a lot more that could be shared (like the data!) that isn't easy to share or isn't shared, at least not yet.
