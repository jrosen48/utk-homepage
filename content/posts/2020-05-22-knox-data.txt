To do:

- Introducing James to the group as co-organizer
- Online vs. F2F meetups?
	- KC guidelines
	- optional office time (can stay )
	- probably not until KC phase 3
- Vision for the group:
	- UTK folks
	- broader, sponsored talks every few months
	- or more tailored to specialized topics
- First meetup: 
	- solicit feedback 
	- discuss an agenda
	- this is a real-time test (on the website, Slack, etc.)
	- if folks come with ideas, then we still have momentum
	- if only six folks show up, we may have to reboot more
	- do this via Zoom
- After the first meetup:
	- do we want to have our first in-person meet-up in the fall
	- possibly, pending updates: August or September
	- other things to think about:
		- what are some topics to cover?
		- how do we begin formulating a strategy for getting the word out?
	- business students
	- folks in valileos' group of faculty
	- folks in engineering dean's group of faculty and department chairs
	- folks in other start-ups in the Knoxville community
