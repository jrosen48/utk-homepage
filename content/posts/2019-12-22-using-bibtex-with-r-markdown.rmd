I'm just beginning to learn BibTeX, which is, according to Wikipedia -@wikipedia2019, "reference management software for formatting lists of references".

It is useful for publishing formats such as R Markdown documents and books created with bookdown, like the [Data Science in Education Using R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) book.

I'm basically using this post to document what I'm learning.

## Adding references

I started with references, which are saved in plain text documents ending in `.bib`. Next, so that R Markdown knows the file(s) to use, you have to add the filename to the front matter of the document. In R Markdown, for example, I can use the plain text file `references.bib`, im which I store references, by adding this line to the YAML front matter:

`bibliography: [references.bib]`

References have a format which is a bit intuitive. Here is an example for our book:

```{code}
@book{dsieur-under-contract,
  author = {Emily A. Bovee and Ryan A. Estrellado and Jesse Mostipak and Joshua M. Rosenberg and Isabella C. Velásquez},
  title = {Data science in education using R},
  year = {under contract},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  url = {https://datascienceineducation.com},
 }
```

The key parts are the `@book` (which can be replaced with `@article`, `@proceedings`, [.etc](http://bib-it.sourceforge.net/help/fieldsAndEntryTypes.php#Entries)), the "key" (which, for us, is `dsieur-under-contract`), and the various fields (e.g., for the title and authors). 

In addition to those used above (for author, title, year, publisher, and url), [others](http://bib-it.sourceforge.net/help/fieldsAndEntryTypes.php#Fields) are also available, including volume, issue, chapter, and editor).

## Adding citations

With a reference saved in the `.bib` file (and the `.bib` file referenced in the document or book front matter), it can be cited in text by referring to the citation key. For example, the following sentence:

```{code}
An aim of *Data science in education using R* is to help to equip those working 
in education, including teachers, data analysts and scientists, researchers, and
administrators to solve problems and ask questions in the context of educational
data and systems [@dsieur-under-contract.]
```

(Oye, I'll leave it to my co-authors to summarize the aims of our book better.)

Would render as the following:

> An aim of *Data science in education using R* is to help to equip those working
in education, including teachers, data analysts and scientists, researchers, and
administrators to solve problems and ask questions in the context of educational
data and systems [@dsieur-under-contract].

References can be cited in different way.

- For parenthetical citations: `[@dsieur-under-contract]` renders as [@dsieur-under-contract] - 
- For in-text citations: `@dsieur-under-contract` renders as @dsieur-under-contract
- For only the year: `-@dsieur-under-contract` renders as -@dsieur-under-contract

## Other notes

- BibTeX only works with R Markdown documents saved as `.Rmd` files - it does not work with `.rmarkdown` (or with `.md`) documents.

- You can add citations to R packages used in a file with the following, wich creates a `.bib` file (called `packges.bib`, in this case):

`knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "packages.bib")`

- This could then be added to the bibliography file, e.g.:

`bibliography: [using-bibtex.bib, packages.bib]`

- References generate automatically. You can add a section heading, e.g., a level three heading for references (`### References`) (as the following heading before the references is).

- The raw `.bib`. file is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrosen48/utk-homepage/master/content/post/references.bib)
