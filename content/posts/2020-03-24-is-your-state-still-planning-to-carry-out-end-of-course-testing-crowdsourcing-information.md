## State testing

My colleague [Isabella Velasquez](https://ivelasq.rbind.io/) and I were wondering what states were doing with respect to end-of-course testing, and found that no comprehensive (of which we were aware) yet existed. As a result, we decided to try to crowdsource this information. 

Has your state announced whether they are postponing end-of-course (or other planned) tests this year in light of COVID-19? Please take a minute or so to add this information to this Google Sheets spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y6WqPhhgRfHcieY4p6OuCFgXXwJvxRvHiRUovllximM/edit#gid=796645619

This spreadsheet includes columns for the following:

- State
- Code
- Testing (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- Date announced
- Link to announcement (preferable)/or news coverage of the change in testing
- Any notes

## School closures

Relatedly, there is some data on school closures in light of COVID-19:

- EdWeek (many districts, but very limited information about them): https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-coronavirus-and-school-closures.html
- CRPE (few districts, but very rich information): https://www.crpe.org/content/covid-19-school-closures
