I had the opportunity to present on *Data Science Education Dilemmas (and Opportunities)* to STEM Education faculty at UT. It was a short, informal presentation, but served as a chance to pull together some ideas. 

A link to the presentation is [here](https://jrosen48.github.io/data-science-dilemmas-presentation/#20).
