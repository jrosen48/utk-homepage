<p>I was recently requested to submit a review with Charles Logan for the book <em>What’s Worth Teaching: Rethinking Curriculum in the Age of Technology</em> by the incredible scholar Allan Collins. A link to the review and book on the Teachers College Record website <a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentID=22173">here</a>. A pre-print of our review is also available <a href="https://github.com/jrosen48/homepage-source/raw/master/static/_media/publications/Rosenberg-Logan-TCR-Review-2017.pdf">here</a>.</p>
