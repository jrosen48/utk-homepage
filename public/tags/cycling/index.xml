      <description>This post includes a few things about getting started bike commuting. The thesis is something like: If you have a bike and a safe route, you can probably commute right away, and then add-on other things (like a rack, fenders, or different tires) over time.

In my experience, roads with bike lanes, or&amp;ndash;even better&amp;ndash;greenways (for runners, walkers, and bikers) are best, followed by neighborhood roads, followed by city roads with street parking.</description>
