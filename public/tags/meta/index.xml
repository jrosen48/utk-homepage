      <description>I have used Wordpress for more than seven years. Over that time, I’ve used multiple shared servers, and have had a myriad of domain names.
Most recently, my shared server at Lansing, MI-based Liquid Web ended, due to Liquid Web leaving the shared hosting business to focus only on dedicated and virtual private servers.
I started to look for a new hosting company, and slowly started to coalesce around the idea of, well, not having one, and using GitHub Pages instead.</description>
