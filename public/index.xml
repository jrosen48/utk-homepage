      <description>Here are some things I learned in the last year. They are all unordered.
Models and parenting and teaching A collabofriend shared &amp;ldquo;the 5 S&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; for soothing babies with me before our son was born, and this was super helpful to me. But, in the last year, our son became a toddler, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do, and I struggled. I tried to find resources for how to parent (and discipline, something I haven&amp;rsquo;t been very good at), and found that a simple idea from the authors of No Drama Discipline clicked with me.</description>

      <title>Hey AERA, what&#39;s up with that?</title>

      <description>I like the American Educational Research Association; it&amp;rsquo;s my professional home.
I was pretty surprised to see this letter, advocating against open access to educational research that is funded through federal agencies (i.e., the Institute of Educational Sciences, the National Science Foundation, etc.).
Inside Higher Ed has an article on AERA&amp;rsquo;s (and other professional organization&amp;rsquo;s) opposition.
Basically, this is wrong. I think AERA is on the wrong side of a trend - driven by access to information through the Internet - toward open access.</description>

      <description>I’m just beginning to learn BibTeX, which is, according to Wikipedia (2019), “reference management software for formatting lists of references”.
It is useful for publishing formats such as R Markdown documents and books created with bookdown, like the Data Science in Education Using R book.
I’m basically using this post to document what I’m learning.
Adding references I started with references, which are saved in plain text documents ending in .</description>

I mentioned this in an earlier post introducing the book: the publisher, Routledge, allowed us to stipulate that we retain the copyright for the web-based version, even after the book is published in print (and e-book) format.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Pixel Slate Chromebook for a little while, and noticed in a recent update that it was possible to install Linux.
This was pretty easy to do (see here). After doing it (it took a few minutes to download Linux, but was otherwise super straightforward), I opened up the command line interface and saw this:
  There are a few things I know how to do through a command line interface; one is to list all of the files and directories available, so I ran the following:</description>

      <description>Since this past summer, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to moderate my use of social media. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a number of strategies (like limiting the amount of time I spend each day), but none have been very effective, apart from a fairly dramatic step, deactivating my accounts, which was effective (until I got back on). While my accounts were deactivated, I missed keeping up with and being in touch with friends and family, but I found other ways to communciate (I actually had two phone calls!</description>

      <description>Since mid-morning this past Friday, members of NARST have been discussing a post and a response to the organization&amp;rsquo;s mailing list.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about how I use my blog to communicate; this is an attempt to do that in the context of that discussion.
I&amp;rsquo;ll lay out my argument in advance, in part because it is simple:
Hazari shared a job post on a mailing list. It was not a blog post, and it certainly was not a blog post on the NARST blog.</description>

      <description>Sparked by a collaboration with Bodong Chen, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a 7th-grade science teacher, Alex Edwards, at Tate&amp;rsquo;s School. We recently wrote about some of the take-aways from our work last year in a publication on &amp;ldquo;Tools and strategies for engaging students in analyzing and interpreting complex data sources.&amp;rdquo;
The article is going to be published in NSTA&amp;rsquo;s The Science Teacher journal (a pre-print of the article is here).</description>

      <description>I was lucky to have the chance to present at the Middle Tennessee State University Math and Science Education Seminar Series.
Presentation My presentation was on Making data science count: Exploring the integration of data science into education.
A link to the presentation is here.
Workshop I also carried out a two-hour workshop on An introduction to data science in education using R. A repository for the workshop, including a link to slides, code, and data, is here: https://github.</description>

      <description>I shared my grant proposal I wrote as a pre-print for a number of reasons:
 The not-very-proprietary nature of this project (with its focus on individual investigator development) I didn’t face any risk of unblinding the review process (as the NSF review process already is) I was the only author, and, so, I felt like there was less risk if I made a mistake: I was the one who would face the consequences!</description>

      <description>I have the opportunity to speak with Dr. Courtney Faber&amp;rsquo;s engineering service-learning course.
In this course, my understanding is that students tackle a design challenge. I was asked to come to class to speak for around 30-minutes around adapting and designing activities for an engineering after school program for elementary-aged students. So, the design challenge is to teach engineering to elementary students about engineering. Cool!
But, I don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; have expertise in engineering or elementary education.</description>

      <description>Note. I am adding to this list throughout the Fall, 2019 semester!
Check-out/Exit ticket questions In many classes I teach, I assign students to base groups, groups of around three or four students who sit together (for most of the time) and &amp;ldquo;check-in&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;check-out&amp;rdquo; of class. The goal of base groups is to foster a kind of positive interdependence among students.
The check out questions are typically the same:</description>

      <description>I love Israel. My spouse can testify to this: After my last trip, with a group of doctoral students and faculty from Michigan State University, I talked about it (and especially the hummus) for months after. I want to go back. Just yesterday, I put mint I cut from my yard into my water bottle, like I saw Israelis do. I have a camp stove that I bought when I first traveled to Israel, when I was 18, that I used less than a month ago on a camping trip.</description>

      <description>I am excited to share that I was recently awarded funding to carry out a new project, Understanding the development of interest in computer science - an experience sampling approach. This is for the project I wrote about here.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from NSF&amp;rsquo;s summary (a bit more is here):
 This project explores STEM interest development at the undergraduate level in computer science. It is a study of national importance that will focus on substantial differences in who pursues an interest, a major, or an occupation in computer science.</description>

      <description>Note. I drafted this right after submitting the proposal but didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to finishing it until now - almost two months later! I kept the language (around the timing) the same, as, there is still no better time than now to share&amp;ndash;though, earlier would have likely been better as the process was more fresh on my mind.
This past week, I submitted a proposal for a grant independently. I thought that there would be no better time than now to just down some thoughts, reflections, and perhaps a few lessons learned from the process of submitting a grant independently, as follows.</description>

      <description>data-science-ish I presented yesterday on Data Science-Ish: The Use of Mixed Effects Models for Analyzing Complex Data at the KnoxData group.
Abstract Here is an abstract for the talk:
 Mixed effects (or multilevel) models are extensions of linear models (regressions) that are commonly used in experimental research and policy and evaluation contexts, but are less widely-used by data scientists. In this talk, I aim to introduce mixed effects model as a data science-ish statistical method that can be useful and is easy to estimate and interpret.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of productive discussion around open education research (or science).
Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed some examples of what I think are good open education research.
Though I think of these as good examples and models for the rest of us to follow, I think some of them are not always appreciated as such. This matters because open education research can then seem like something that is not relevant or too onerous.</description>

I have something that seems to work and so thought I would share what I did as a first attempt.</description>

      <description>With my colleagues Emily Bovee (who had the idea for the project and is the first author) and John Ranellucci, I worked on a conference proposal for a conference that provided either a Word Document template or a LaTeX class. Since I had just used (that’s a generous way to put it - I really had struggled through it) LaTeX, I proposed that we see whether we could (continue to) use R and R Markdown, which we used to analyze the data, to prepare the manuscript.</description>

      <description>Social network is increasingly common in education (Sweet, 2016). Very often, social network analysis is used to create sociograms, or depictions of a network. I did this in a paper I recently co-authored (here is a pre-print), we worked hard to create this figure:

Such figures (we thought–and I think) look nice and they are often useful for understanding the characteristics of a network and the relations that are part of it.</description>

      <description>In August of last year, I wrote a post that involved looking at when educational psychology jobs (mostly, but not only, academic jobs or those related to research and teaching) were posted to the excellent Ed Psych Jobs website. As that post made (in part) the (anticipated) point that most jobs were posted in September (in which 16% of jobs were posted there) and October (14%) (followed by August, with 11%), I thought that it may be helpful to see how accurate that was over the past year.</description>

      <description>Last summer, I taught the MAET Year 2 Summer Cohort with Danah Henriksen. After teaching the class, Danah realized she had taught five cohorts of (awesome) students and that we had some information available from pre- and post-course self-reported surveys to understand how students grew in terms of their confidence in using different educational (and other) technologies.
That research idea evolved into a study with Rohit Mehta that involved, among other findings, a visualization of average pre-post values for specific technologies.</description>

As part of this position, I&amp;rsquo;ll teach science teaching methods (and science and STEM education research-related) courses. Hearing about the first course I&amp;rsquo;ll teach sparked me to gather these.
So, this is a loosely-organized collection of some resources&amp;ndash;especially some new(er) books and National Academies Press (NAP) reports&amp;ndash;related to science teaching and learning. I leave &amp;ldquo;oldies but goodies&amp;rdquo;, like Taking Science to School (2007), the Framework for K-12 Science Education (2012), and America&amp;rsquo;s Lab Report (2006) for example.</description>

      <description>This post includes a few things about getting started bike commuting. The thesis is something like: If you have a bike and a safe route, you can probably commute right away, and then add-on other things (like a rack, fenders, or different tires) over time.
The most important thing - a safe route! The most important thing is a safe route! In my experience, roads with bike lanes, or&amp;ndash;even better&amp;ndash;greenways (for runners, walkers, and bikers) are best, followed by neighborhood roads, followed by city roads with street parking.</description>

      <description>Outside of education, one of my interests is cycling, and one of my favorite ways to cycle is on rail-trails, pathways and greenways that are converted from former railroad tracks.
In a side-project (and because the data source can be used for teaching and learning about complex, nested data), I collected information from the TrailLink website. I’ve blogged about this data here and here to find out what the best rail-trails in Michigan are and to find out what the characteristics of the best rail-trails are, respectively.</description>

      <description>As part of a revise and resubmit decision for a paper (that was just accepted to the Journal of Youth and Adolescence (pre-print here)), we (Patrick Beymer, Jennifer Schmidt, and I) were asked by the editor to carry out sensitivity analysis for findings. Our understanding was that, in this context, sensitivity analysis means one of two things - or both:
 How results hold up under different specfications of an analyses How much bias would have to be present to invalidate an inference  Over the past year or so, I had learned about sensitivity analysis from a class and then work with Ken Frank.</description>

As part of this longitudinal project, we carried out field experiments to understand the impact of specific features of the curriculum.
In this paper published in the International Journal of Educational Research with Mete Akcaoglu, John Ranellucci, Christina Schwarz, and I examined whether asking students to generate ideas about how what they were learning about could be useful in the future.</description>

Background Research in classrooms and schools can be complex because of all of the factors that matter. A question that often comes up when we say that we observed some pattern in data is, but did you control for X?
In the context of working on an approach to find out how impactful an omitted variable would need to be to invalidate an inference, we had to modify a function that worked for a single sensitivity analysis to work for many and to be easier to use.</description>

      <description>Because of interest and the need for better examples (for teaching and for use in tools under-development), such as prcr and tidyLPA, I worked to create two data packages, data easily available through an R package.
A benefit of the data being in an R package is that it is even easier to access than other formats (in R): Just load the name of the package and type the name of the data frame, or, if the data is included as built-in data in another package (one that is loaded), just type the name of the data frame.</description>

      <description>I will be hosting a webinar on Engaging students in authentic “data practices” in online science classes with Michigan Virtual Learning Research Institute, the research organization associated with Michigan’s state-wide online school. The webinar is today (10/18) at 2pm EDT and is available via https://connect.mivu.org/mvlri
Here is a bit more information on the webinar:
 Not only in science and science education but also our everyday lives, data are powerful, but opportunities for students to think of and with data as part of their learning are limited.</description>

      <description>Through a few different projects and people (such as SIPS and rOpenSci and conversations with friends / colleagues both online and offline), I have been exposed to the idea of open science.
I’m actually going to punt for the moment. Here’s a definition that sounds about right to me:
 Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years, I have worked with Jennifer Schmidt and Patrick Beymer to explore student engagement in science using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). Most recently, we used what scholars have referred to as a “person-in-context” approach, using both ESM and a person-oriented approach.
A figure is helpful for conveying how the person-oriented approach can be used to find common momentary engagement profiles:
We examine how common these profiles are in laboratory activities and on the basis of students’ ability to make choices.</description>

      <description>Between commuting by bicycle and working, I listen to a lot of podcasts. I listen to podcasts to learn something new, keep up with the news, and, occasionally, hear other viewpoints. I thought it would be worth sharing a few that I (almost) never miss downloading and listening to, especially those that others may not regularly hear about, are new, or are sort of niche in terms of the audience.</description>

      <description>Note that due to version-related issues the code in this post is displayed but is not excecuted/run.
According to the MPlus website, the R package MPlusAutomation serves three purposes:
Creating related groups of models Running batches Extracting and tabulating model parameters and test statistics.  Because modeling involves comparing related models, (partially) automating these is compelling. It can make it easier to use model results in subsequent analyses and can cut down on copy and pasting output or results between programs.</description>

      <description>Note - an R package for carrying out Latent Profile Analysis (LPA): tidyLPA Since writing this post, I have worked with colleagues to release an R package to carry out the analysis. The package is tidyLPA and is described in the following sections, through the “Original Post” header below which is the beginning of the original post.
Introduction Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) is a statistical modeling approach for estimating distinct profiles, or groups, of variables.</description>

      <guid>/post/2017/08/15/comparing-mixed-effects-and-linear-models/</guid>
      <description>Some background One reason to use mixed effects models is that they help to account for data with a complex structure, such as multiple responses (to questions, for example) from the same people, students grouped into classes, and measures collected over time. Often, the way they account for these complex structures is in terms of reducing their bias, which has to do with when a model comes up with an estimate that is off - too large, too small, or maybe too certain (or uncertain) relative to the true value of the thing that is estimated.</description>

      <description>Catching up I wrote a blog post (one that, to be honest, I liked a lot) on what the best rail-trails are in Michigan (here). A friend and colleague at MSU, Andy, noticed that paved trails seemed to be rated higher, and this as well as my cfriend and colleague Kristy’s comment about how we can use the output of the the previous post sparked my curiosity in trying to figure out what characteristics predict how highly (or not highly) rated trails are.</description>

I had just purchased a copy of their book Rail-Trails Michigan and Wisconsin, and wanted to see whether I could learn more from the website.
To start, I checked whether they had a way to access the reviews on the site through an API.</description>

      <description>Background How many groups, or types, of Star Wars characters are there? I’ve been wanting to use the starwars dataset built-in to the dplyr package, and at the same time, have been working hard on an R package to carry out an analysis suited to doing this. Part of the challenge of using the approach in this R package is determining how groups groups there are.
Many approaches (Latent Profile Analysis, for example) use Maximum Likelihood estimation (while the approach I’ve developed uses a two-step cluster analysis based around the geometric (and algebraic) idea of “distance”, or how close (similar) observations are).</description>

      <description>Around two years ago, I was fortunate to not have to work in the summer: I had a research fellowship from May - August through the College of Education at MSU.
As a result, I didn’t buy a parking pass for the summer. I still came in to campus, but since I didn’t have any official, regularly-scheduled meetings, I thought I could bike in when I needed to. I had biked to campus before, so I was familiar with the route and where I would park my bike, but I didn’t regularly commute.</description>

      <description>The R package for person-oriented analysis (prcr) is updated (it’s now version 0.1.4).
In particular, it was not clear how to use the profile assignments (i.e., what cluster each response is in) in subsequent analyses. So, the update now returns two different representations of the profile assignments, or which profile is associated with each observation: a) the original “data.frame” with the profile assignment added in one variable and b) the original “data.</description>

 On broadcast channels We first looked at mentions across ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, and PBS (the way newsflash works is to keyword search the closed captioning streams from the Internet Archive’s Television News Archive):</description>

The goal for the conference was to kickstart data science education and to explore an educational technology, Concord Consortium’s Common Online Data Analysis Platform. What’s the big idea about data science education? To me, it’s a recognition that data is power, and that through asking questions, collecting and creating data, analyzing and modeling data, and making sense of and communicating what is going on can be empowering to learners.</description>

      <description>I’m excited to share that prcr (0.1.0), an R package for person-centered analysis, is now available on CRAN via install.packages(&amp;quot;prcr&amp;quot;).
Person-centered analyses focus on clusters, or profiles, of observations, and their change over time or differences across factors.
The package is designed to be “low threshold but high ceiling”, in that you can do all of the analysis with one function, create_profiles(df, n_clusters), where dfis a data.frame of the variables to cluster, and n_clusters is the specified number of clusters.</description>

      <description>Data Science in Educational Research Data science is commonly characterized as a field that integrates disciplinary expertise, statistics, and advanced computational techniques to answer questions or solve problems. In education, data science education has potential as a set of ideas and practices that cut across STEM content areas and can also be meaningful to learners, but the potential for data in education has not yet been fully realized. My research focuses on how learners think of and with data, particularly in science education settings.</description>

      <description>My service focuses on activities at the department and college level and in my discipline and local community. Collectively, this service serves a role in the organizations at each of these levels. In addition, most of this service is also complimentary with my aims as a scholar and teacher, as I describe in this statement.
At the department and college level, as a beginning faculty member, thus far, I have been involved in admissions panels for the science education program.</description>

      <description>Teaching Philosophy As a former high school science teacher, I know that teaching science is challenging. My teaching philosophy for educating future teachers (and students at any level) is to involve them in what Grossman et al. (2009) describe as an approximation of practice, reflecting a view of teaching and learning as participating in the practices of the field. Accordingly, I aim to involve students in authentic practices from the field of study.</description>
