<p><strong>PI, Understanding the development of interest in computer science: An experience sampling approach ($346,688). National Science Foundation. (National Science Foundation Grant No. 1937700)</strong></p>
<p>This project explores STEM interest development at the undergraduate level in computer science. It is a study of national importance that will focus on substantial differences in who pursues an interest, a major, or an occupation in computer science. The study will look at what drives these differences at a level where policymakers and educators seeking to support and sustain a more representative population of computer science experts can most effectively act. To address this problem, the project will conduct a study that articulates a fundamental research project appropriate for the ECR program using the experience sampling method (ESM). The investigator will enlist mentors and advisory board members with expertise using this methodology to help identify experiences, expertise, and competencies the investigator will need to develop during the two-year project period. Building on the advice of these experts, the investigator will receive assistance in study design, research methods, and data analysis. A deeper understanding of these broad categories will help the investigator use a variety of approaches and measures to examine students&rsquo; individual characteristics, construct surveys, study variation in students&rsquo; experiences, and structure timelines for the ESM study. Through the professional development plan, the investigator will address these needs by participating in subject-specific conferences, workshops, short courses, research groups, and mentoring activities in both research methodology and computer science relative to STEM interest development.</p>
<p>The pilot study will be carried out in the context of an introductory undergraduate computer science course using a pool of 200 students and will be framed in terms of the interest development theory to better understand how students&rsquo; in-the-moment interest is sparked in specific situations and then accumulates into more ongoing and sustained individual interest. Specifically, ESM will allow the investigator to monitor a short-term intervention to explore how situational interest may change over time into well-developed individual interest. The pilot study will seek to determine if this method is more suitable for understanding situational interest and if so, under what conditions. Data will be collected through pre-post surveys, an experience sampling survey, and short written reports and will be analyzed using multivariate, mixed effects models that will consider the relationship between situational and individual interest. Outcomes from this project will be two-fold: an advancement in the investigator&rsquo;s methodological knowledge relative to ESM; and a deeper understanding about how student&rsquo;s interest may develop in computer science as well as what barriers might interfere with such development. The project is supported through the EHR Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition that is designed to build individuals&rsquo; capacity to carry out high quality fundamental STEM education research in STEM education.</p>
<p><strong>Co-PI, Advancing computational grounded theory for audiovisual data from STEM classrooms (PI: Christina Krist, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Tennessee, Knoxville subcontract: $101,469)). National Science Foundation. (National Science Foundation Grant No. 1920796)</strong></p>
<p>Video data are complex and involve visual, acoustic, spatial, and temporal features that can be reduced in several ways. To date, analysis of video data of STEM classrooms has not been able to leverage computational power to take advantage of their richness. However, recent advancements in data science, coupled with existing speech analytics methods, make it possible to computationally identify important features from video in ways that preserve complexity and nuance. These advancements will improve research replicability. The methods developed through this project will facilitate use of sophisticated computational analysis with video data by more researchers. Application of these new methods will help increase the scale and generalizability of video research and lead to the building of new theory.</p>
<p>This research project builds on state-of-the-art computer vision and speech analytics methods tested on video data collected in STEM classrooms. It does so within a computational grounded theory methodological framework, which leverages the interpretive power of grounded analytical approaches with the processing power of computational methods. Specifically, two types of computational analysis procedures will be produced: (a) extracting meaningful features from video and audio data of STEM classrooms, and (b) conducting exploratory pattern identification using these extracted features. To develop these procedures, existing large-scale video datasets of STEM classrooms will be used to test and refine increasingly sophisticated analyses, which will also be used to demonstrate the application of these methods to investigate the social and spatial dimensions of STEM classrooms. The project focuses on integrating these methods to improve their power and leverages existing large-scale datasets of STEM classrooms, such that the methods developed can be tested on realistic data. The datasets are extensive enough to support the investigation of a wide range of research questions, including high-inference questions about students&rsquo; participation in disciplinary practices. Finally, by pairing computational and grounded analytical methods, the project is developing methods that have the potential to enhance and test construct validity of the patterns found in the data.</p>
<p><strong>CS for Appalachia: A research-practice partnership for integrating computer science into East Tennessee schools (PI: Lynn Hodge, University of Tennessee, Knoxville). National Science Foundation. (National Science Foundation Grant No. 1923509)</strong></p>
<p>East Tennessee is a region in the heart of Appalachia marked by deep cultural roots and persistent challenges to providing students with substantial computer science (CS) learning experiences. Attention to opportunities for students to engage with CS ideas and practices is urgent and timely in light of new CS standards for the State of Tennessee being implemented in the Fall of 2019. To address the needs of students in East Tennessee Appalachia, this project provides professional development (PD) for teachers to plan for and teach CS strategies that are responsive to students and their communities. This project employs a research-practice partnership among researchers, teachers and administrators to address challenges related to teaching CS, such as access to high-quality professional learning for teachers and technical infrastructure. This collaborative work brings together the University of Tennessee, three rural East Tennessee school districts, and key community organizations. Building and strengthening this partnership enhances learning and lifelong outcomes for students by increasing their opportunities to engage with CS in the elementary grades. For stakeholders as well as researchers, the project leads to an enhanced understanding of how rural school districts create opportunities for students to engage meaningfully with CS and to a strong partnership that will enhance CS education in Appalachia in the years to come.</p>
<p>This project&rsquo;s overarching goal is to strengthen, broaden and formalize existing collaborations through work sessions focused upon community learning, foundational CS ideas, knowledge and practice around culturally relevant pedagogy, and a shared vision. The project develops CS standards-aligned professional development for K-5 teachers to (1) engage students in activities that connect with Appalachian culture and lived experiences and (2) cultivate students&rsquo; interests in and understanding of CS and issues beyond their immediate communities. Research activities involve exploring teacher identity development related to CS and teaching CS, as well as studying teacher learning as a product of their involvement in the PD. The evaluation focuses on efforts to strengthen the research-practice partnership by providing formative and summative feedback to the leadership group. Results are shared with the CS education community across Tennessee and the nation through presentations at conferences and workshops and publications. This collaboration provides new insights for encouraging the development of systematic approaches to some of the most persistent STEM education issues faced by the most isolated school districts.</p>
