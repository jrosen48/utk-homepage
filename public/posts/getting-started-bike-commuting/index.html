<main>
<p>This post includes a few things about getting started bike commuting. The thesis is something like: <strong>If you have a bike and a safe route, you can probably commute right away, and then add-on other things (like a rack, fenders, or different tires) over time.</strong></p>
<h1 id="the-most-important-thing---a-safe-route">The most important thing - a safe route!</h1>
<p>The most important thing is a safe route! In my experience, roads with bike lanes, or&ndash;even better&ndash;greenways (for runners, walkers, and bikers) are best, followed by neighborhood roads, followed by city roads with street parking.</p>
<p>For other roads (those without a bike lane or those not in a neighborhood or those with street parking), I would like for at least two of the three characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>speed limit below 40 miles per hour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not too busy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide shoulder</p>
<p>If a road does not have two of these, I would try to only go on it during one-off situations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-bike">A bike!</h1>
<p>I think you can commute with any bike. So, to start, I think almost any bike works. More on this in a moment!</p>
<h1 id="the-next-group-of-important-things---the-essentials">The next group of important things - the essentials</h1>
<p>I think the next group of important things is there pieces of gear:</p>
<ul>
<li>A helmet</li>
<li>A lock</li>
<li>A taillight</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy inexpensive versions of all three, or more expensive versions of all three that may be lighter, last longer, or look cooler. If you&rsquo;re in an area that needs it, do consider a more expensive lock (which actually may be an exception to the general trend of more <code>$$$</code> things being lighter) Either the inexpensive or expensive versions are probably a-okay.</p>
<p>You can commute without any of these three, but when I don&rsquo;t have one or more of them, I&rsquo;m usually stressed about it. I&rsquo;d add a backpack to this list, but you probably already have one.</p>
<h1 id="things-that-you-can-get-as-you-cycle-more">Things that you can get as you cycle more</h1>
<p>After a helmet, lock, and taillight, some things that are definitely useful, but are not absolutely essential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fenders (front and rear, for keeping water off of you when it rains)</li>
<li>A rear rack (for attaching pannier bags)</li>
<li>Panniers or other bags (there are some cool briefcase or backpack-like ones) to attach to a rack</li>
<li>A front light (for seeing and being seen when it is dark or at dusk)</li>
<li>Nicer tires (particularly for riding in wintery conditions - I actually don&rsquo;t think studded winter tires are necessary, as wider, nobbier tires are good)</li>
<li>A bell (almost in the essentials category - especially if you&rsquo;re biking in a busy area!)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-commuting-whats-that-anyway-bike">A commuting (what&rsquo;s that anyway?) bike</h1>
<p>Along with things that you can add as you cycle more, I think a commuting bike can be useful. In my experience, there is not really a category for commuting bikes, but rather are a number of categories of bikes that can serve as possible commuters. In particular, hybrid, touring, cyclocross, and city bikes can all meet the bill; I think the most important factor is the capability to add things like those in the above group (fenders, rack, etc.). Also, finding a bike you like and that looks cool is important, too.</p>
<h1 id="the-last-group---non-essentials">The last group - non-essentials</h1>
<p>After the essentials and the things that you can add-on as you cycle more come things that are absolutely not essential, but can make the commute more convenient and comfortable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some kind of light-weight, waterproof jacket (does not need to be cycling-specific, though cycling-specific jackets may have some nice features like reflective stripes and bright colors)</li>
<li>Waterproof pants (definitely not essential; definitely very nice when it is raining hard)</li>
<li>A power-generating (dynamo) hub (to power the front and rear lights; a luxury!)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>To sum up, this post was on some ideas for getting started bike commuting. To get started, you need a safe route. You almost certainly need a helmet, lock, and rear taillight. There are a number of things that make cycling and commuting more fun or easy, though, like a new bike, you can get them over time and as you find the need for them.</p>
