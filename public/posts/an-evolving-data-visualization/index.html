<p>Last summer, I taught the <a href="http://edutech.educ.msu.edu/programs/masters/summer-hybrid/0">MAET Year 2 Summer Cohort</a> with <a href="http://danah-henriksen.com/">Danah Henriksen</a>. After teaching the class, Danah realized she had taught five cohorts of (awesome) students and that we had some information available from pre- and post-course self-reported surveys to understand how students grew in terms of their confidence in using different educational (and other) technologies.</p>
<p>That research idea evolved into a study with <a href="http://mehtarohit.com/">Rohit Mehta</a> that involved, among other findings, a visualization of average pre-post values for specific technologies. Over back-and-forth emails, Rohit and I shaped the figure up into <em>what we think</em> is a good representation, using the <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> R package.</p>
<p>We realized our back-and-forth in terms of our revisions was possibly interesting to the extent that it showed us that there isn&rsquo;t often one right way to create a figure using, but playing around and revising one can help.</p>
<p>Also, we thought the findings were interesting! Alignment represents how much of a focus the particular technology was over the course of the three summer classes; students seemed to grow, even in technologies that <em>were not the focus of or aligned with the activities in the classes</em>.</p>
<p>We were generating these interactively and did not think to save or commit earlier versions; but the code for the final version (version 5, below) is (in a not very edited form) <a href="https://github.com/jrosen48/maet-analysis/blob/master/Survey%20Results%20Update.Rmd">here</a>.</p>
