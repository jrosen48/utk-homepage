# An examination of students

With [Christina Schwarz](http://schwarz.wiki.educ.msu.edu/), I presented on an examination of students' epistemic considerations with an automated approach at the [National Association for Research in Science Teaching Annual International Conference](http://narst.org). Slides from the presentation are available here ([PDF](/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NARST_2016_Rosenberg_Schwarz_4_14_16_to_present.pdf)).
